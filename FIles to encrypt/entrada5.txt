(00:45) the president who's called reporters the enemy the people is a welcome surprise our journey begins aboard Air Force one the high-tech deluxe 747 jumbo jet with 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels including an extensive suite for the president it's commonly called the flying Oval Office during the two and a half hour flight to Iowa the president meets with government officials is briefed on the state's recent flooding 30,000 feet below former Vice President Joe Biden on the ground in Iowa on the stump and on the attack I
(01:27) believe that the president is literally an existential threat to America 3:15 p.m. we join the president in his brand-new presidential limo the Beast while its state-of-the-art secrets are closely held it's reportedly equipped with tear gas can lay out an oil slick in the event of a terrorist attack there's even a refrigerated supply of the president's blood type in case of emergency what a drink no these people they're so great anyway George when did you know you like campaigning thank you yeah the Beast enjoy it I mean these
(02:02) people are so incredible look they're crying I'm so cute this is some piece of machinery notice actually I could say feel the window Jake's not gonna look lad you sorta make me hi everybody so this trip has turned into something a little bit different with the former vice president's decision today well what was this decision they come to Iowa is that a good thing for you that he's in Iowa where he made a speech I watched it you tend to doze off but I watched it this is a guy who does everything to separate
(02:36) and frighten people it was fine I mean it's a political speech he's still leading the polls on the Democratic side it's lightening up a little bit and lightening up a lot which is interesting but he's still beating you according to the well I don't believe in those pearls there's no way he beats me in Texas but even your own polls show you're behind right now don't they know my polls show that I'm winning everywhere I don't know we vote we've all seen these reports
(02:59) that would 15 out of 17 states he spent 2 million on a poll and you're behind in 15 out of 17 states nobody showed you those polls because those polls don't exist you those polls don't exist but I just had a meeting with somebody that's a pollster and I'm winning everywhere so I don't know what you to say you know you don't feel like you're behind right now you're not fighting for my I've haven't even started yet but we're getting tremendous pulse those poll results so irritating to the president
(03:25) that a few seconds later he has to go off the record to call his campaign manager okay so hold it off for a little while just call Brennan and I want to ask him that question okay days later we would get the internal Trump polling data confirmed by the campaign it showed the president far behind in key battleground states earlier this spring back on the record we arrived at his first stop of the day an ethanol plant in Council Bluffs Iowa is good it's an area that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 election and
(03:56) helped deliver the biggest margin for Republicans since Ronald Reagan ladies and gentlemen President Donald J Trump thank you very much Iowa we love Iowa thank you very much thank you please sit down sit down otherwise so sad got no standing ovations the president is using this speech to sell his economic strategy but it's also a chance to hit back at Joe Biden sleepy Joe he was someplace in Iowa today and he said my name so many times that people couldn't stand it anymore no don't keep saying it
(04:37) sleepy guy okay 4:46 p.m. we're back in the Beast interview these are the people that couldn't get in headed to Air Force One for a second stop in Des Moines a Republican Party fundraiser that evening elections are about tomorrow night yesterday whether you go to voters over this next year what is the big unfinished piece of business you're missing this is so we almost had health care done healthcare is a disaster obamacare but we've managed it much better than they managed it so we've made it serviceable but it's
(05:13) not great we're gonna produce phenomenal health care and we already have the concept of the plan and it'll be questioned tell you to put the planet yeah well we'll be announcing that in about two months maybe less in preparation for this trip we went on to talk to a lot of voters here in Iowa supporters of yours right and a lot of them say they voted for you they're proud of you they're gonna vote for you again most of them maybe we should cut back on the twins at times with his tweed side what are some times he's over
(05:45) reacts I think he could tone down some his his rhetoric and his tweets and so forth it's the tweets I just the things he's it's just not necessary I have a very unfair press it's a fake news it's a corrupt news if I don't use social media I do not get the word out I put it out and then it goes on to your platform I put one out this morning and as soon as I press the button they said we have breaking news for every Network every station do we have breakers they read my tweet why is that bad
(06:17) good there talk about those you're calling people names it's - do you know what I'll bet they do like it they may tell you that but I bet they like it you know what's your pitch to the swing voter on it's safety security great economy and I think I've done more than any other first term president ever I have a phony witch-hunt which is just a phony pile of stuff Muller comes out there's no collusion and essentially a ruling that no obstruction and they keep going with it you know what people are angry about
(06:45) it I don't think that's an example you don't have time for that now we'll talk about this later found excuse me he found no collusion and he didn't find anything having to do with obstruction because they made a ruling based on his findings and they said no it didn't examine collusion he laid out evidence and structure but were you trying to say now that there was collusion even though he said there is no collusion he didn't think there's we said no collusion he said he didn't look at
(07:08) George the report said no collusion did you either work yes I did and you should read it [Music] [Applause] [Music] Wow I can take credit the credit Stephen thank you all very much thank you thank you man [Music] and later at that fundraiser Trump pulls the crowd on his 2020 campaign slogan we have to make a decision make America great again or keep America great you know here tonight George Stephanopoulos the great you accept but I where are you George she's around here someplace and he he happens to be a nice guy so after about
