Transcript:
(00:04) tonight addressing the nation in a rare prime time address the president prepares to urge Americans to take stock as two Wars rage overseas how Biden will look to connect those conflicts with the lives of millions of Americans and what he could ask from Congress plus it's uh truly been a system that is a game changer it's Israel's world-renowned missile defense system in tonight's Prime Focus we take you up close close to the multibillion dollar Iron Dome protecting millions of Israelis and I
(00:36) believe it is a constitutional desecration the word chaos is unable to properly describe the unprecedented moment taking over Capitol Hill the developments today that could leave the country without an elected house speaker for months good evening I'm philp off in tonight for Lindsey Davis thanks so much for streaming with us tonight with tensions quickly escalating in the Middle East we are set to hear from President Biden in a rare prime time Oval Office address it comes with two Wars overseas right now in Ukraine in
(01:08) the Middle East with allies looking for America to show leadership on the world stage and tonight the US taking action in the Middle East a Navy destroyer intercepting a number of missiles and drones possibly headed toward Israel the state department also issuing a worldwide caution alert for Americans abroad due to increased tensions and potential terrorist attacks this is a map of the region those projectiles were fired from Yemen highlighted there in red at the bottom of the screen toward the North toward
(01:38) Israel that you see up top in the red that nation is some, 1300 miles away meantime Israel's military is now ready to escalate the country's defense minister telling troops they will soon see Gaza from the inside that's a direct quote Israel's air strikes in Gaza are unrelenting a Target near a hospital in Gaza City with was struck twice overnight and on that dire need for Aid to get into Gaza the Rafa border crossing could open as soon as tomorrow that's down near Egypt after the deal brokered by President Bri Biden but late
(02:13) today we are learning efforts to open that border continue to run into roadblocks our team is in the region tonight following it all and we begin with Chief Global Affairs correspondent Martha Raditz tonight for the first time the US has taken military action in this war to defend Israel the US has Carney a guided missile destroyer in the northern Red Sea shooting down three land attack cruise missiles and several drones they say were launched from Yemen possibly towards Israel by Iran backed hooti forces we cannot say for certain what
(02:49) these missiles and drones were targeting but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea potentially towards Targets in Israel the US is bolstering its Firepower in the region a second carrier strike group joining us warships already in the Mediterranean an additional fighter aircraft also being sent all meant as a deterrent we aim to send a strong message intended to deter a wider conflict to bolster Regional stability and of course to make it clear that we will protect and defend our national
(03:21) security interests and tonight real concern for US forces in the region with attacks against us bases in Iraq and Syria in the past 24 hours and another today one drone shot down no injuries reported but a US contractor Sheltering in place in Iraq died of cardiac arrest and Martha joins me now from Tel Aviv Martha the US hopes obviously this intercept is a deterrent but what's the risk of all of this actually further inflaming the region Phil this is a troubling sign to say the least but a senior official
(03:58) telling me tonight that the hope is that this use of force will only bolster the show of force and solidify the deterrence Phil all right Martha RIT Martha thank you President Biden is set to speak to the nation at this extraordinary moment two Wars Ukraine and Russia and now Israel and Hamas the president is set to make the case that supporting us allies helps make Americans safe but he's also going to have to ask Congress for money to do that a congress as you know without a speaker of the house so let's get right
(04:30) to Mary Bruce at the White House and Mary what more are you learning tonight about what the president will say well Phil the president I'm told is going to outline what is at stake in the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East he is going to outline why these fights matter to Americans why Americans should care and he's going to argue that it is in our national security interest for the us to continue supporting our allies in these fights we have learned that he is going to be asking Congress for roughly
(04:57) a hundred billion dollar in foreign aid including roughly $60 billion for Ukraine And1 billion for Israel but as you know that is a tall order right now and something he's not likely to get uh at least not very soon given the fact that the house is still at a standstill without a speaker now this rare Oval Office address of course comes just 24 hours after the president's trip to Israel we're told he also spoke on the phone today with Ukrainian president zalinski and Phil I'm told you can expect these remarks to also be
(05:26) heartfelt the president is keenly aware that so many people are really suffering that recent events have been incredibly painful for so many Americans and so he will address that as well these are remarks that I'm told the president has been really involved personally in in crafting that he worked on these remarks while he was on the plane yesterday making his way back here to the White House that he has been tweaking them late into the day Phil all right Mary Bruce from the White House Mary thank you thank you Israel is signaling its
(05:58) ground war into Gaza Maybe iminent the Israeli defense minister going as far as telling troops they will soon see Gaza quote from the inside ABC's Chief foreign correspondent Ian panel on what's expected and what we know so far tonight Israel's defense minister promising his troops they'll soon see Gaza from the inside suggesting a ground offensive may be imminent satellite images show hundreds of Israeli tanks and armored vehicles amassed north of Gaza along with hundreds of thousands of troops and inside Gaza the aerial
(06:32) Onslaught has been Relentless Israel here pounding the same Target twice closed to a hospital its military saying it struck hundreds of Hamas targets across Gaza overnight 13 straight days of bombing and civilian casualties Gaza saturated in grief and anger there's no safe place says Hassan they're dropping bombs on children's heads the images tough to watch as rescue was claw through the rubble trying to free children from under the debris the number of dead there fast approaching 4,000 according to local
(07:07) Health officials almost 2 weeks after Hamas slaughtered over 14400 people in Israel taking more than 200 hostage and tonight haunting new images showing Hamas terrorists firing on concert goers at that October 7th Music Festival the footage posted online recovered by Israeli First Responders nearby at kibuts near o today a somber reminder of how this all began Hamas going on a bloodthirsty Rampage here too dozens killed and even more kidnapped house after house has been ransacked again you can see where Hamas have tried
(07:45) to burn the house tried to set fire to the people inside and inside the building itself is just utterly gutted you can almost smell death and fear here Lieutenant Colonel Richard hect visited this peaceful rural community before the attack today seeing the Carnage here for the first time we're going to have to destroy Kamas we don't have It's Our obligation we don't we can't have this happen again all the way yeah and Ian joins us now from Tel Aviv Ian has there been any movement on getting that Aid into
(08:16) Gaza I mean what we're hearing this comes from Egyptian State TV is that an agreement has been struck to finally open that border crossing it goes from the Sinai desert this is on the Egyptian side into Southern Gaza we understand there are about 20 trucks or so gathered there they contain food uh medicine water things that are now in dire shortage inside Gaza now the United Nations is saying that 20 isn't enough they need at least 100 trucks a day but even so if there is this breakthrough that will provide at least a little
(08:49) relief and send a positive signal one other thing though there are also significant numbers of foreign Nationals in Gaza who've been trapped inside there by the bombing at least 500 American passport holders they've also been desperate to get out at the moment no sign that they will necessarily be allowed to leave immediately but again those negotiations are ongoing Meanwhile we're hearing the conditions inside Gaza deteriorating daily surgery at some Hospitals now reportedly being carried out without anesthetic Phil no terrific
(09:21) much needed Aid Ian panel from Tel Aviv and thank you and of course caught in the middle of all this more than 200 hostages tonight horrific news for one Israeli family we've been following five members of the family were among the missing today relatives received a dreaded call about two of them here's ABC's Brit clinet we've been following the harrowing story of the Dan family for nearly two weeks now five relatives feared taken away by Hamas a grandmother her three grandchildren and her son-in-law that
(09:53) grandmother an American citizen this was the last call from one of the granddaughters just 12 years old calling her mother as heras militants opened fire on their grandmother's home where she was [Music] staying and tonight the heartbreaking news that 12-year-old girl Noya and her grandmother Carmela confirmed dead the Israel Defense Forces saying their bodies were found on the edge of Gaza that grandmother's daughter telling me today of the horrible knock at the door I was on the floor and crying and then they told
(10:49) me my mom and and no are gone and I was like I met no's mother a week ago as she prayed her 12-year-old who who had autism would come home you can't start to imagine especially my girl of course she's I'm so sorry tonight that mother now preparing to bury her 12-year-old while her sister waits for word on her own two children I don't have even a time to to to to grab to to to feel my pain I don't have time I can't even stop for a minute and to grave of them if this happened to my mom
(11:41) and and my niece I don't know what's going to happen to my children and Brit joins us now Brit what are Israeli officials now saying about the effort to get those hostages released well look what we do know that there's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes and that Partners in the region are working working together and the American government they say they're doing everything they can to get the American hostages home what we do know though is like Noya there IDF said that there are 30 children among the hostages
(12:11) held in Gaza saying that in negotiations the priority will be women children and the sick Phil all right Brit Clinton thanks so much and while America watches the deepening conflict between Israel and Hamas the war in Ukraine continues to rage Russia appears to have renewed its offensive President Biden now tasked with addressing the nation making the case for why the US needs to stand with both Israel and Ukraine ABC's Patrick reval in ke tonight hi Phil President Biden's Oval Office addressed tonight will be closely
(12:45) watched here in keev with the world's attention pulled to Israel and a new Russian offensive here there is deepening anxiety in Ukraine over us support and concerns whether Congress will find a way to pass more military aid people here feel the shift in a attention in the US and they're worried I spoke today to a former Ukrainian defense minister Andre zahar nuk and he told me he had a simple hope for President Biden's speech that it would remind us politicians why America First supported Ukraine the sense of horror at
(13:14) what Russia was doing to ukrainians but also that it's in the US's strategic interest a Russian Victory would weaken the Democratic World Order and threaten Europe and he said none of that has changed if USA did dry up Ukrainian officials say Ukraine could face shortages of kyam within months Russian forces are on the offensive again in eastern Ukraine right now and it underlines the kremlin's determination the scenario where Ukraine is left badly damaged partly occupied and at risk of slowly being suffocated
(13:42) by Putin has not gone away and the war can quickly turn into something that looks a lot more like a victory for Vladimir Putin Phil Patrick Revel and ke Ukraine tonight for us Patrick thank you let's bring in now ABC's Jay O'Brien who's on Capitol Hill Jay we're s to hear hear from the president as you know on this request for more aid for both Ukraine and Israel tonight I know you don't have a crystal ball but you cover you cover this part of the area how is that request likely to play in this
(14:13) Congress right now yeah first and foremost Phil several Administration sources as you've heard have said that this package will be about a hundred billion dollar in foreign aid 60 billion of it for Ukraine 10 billion of it for Israel that's likely to have broad bipartisan support in the Senate both the Senate top Senate Republican top Senate Democrat Mitch McConnell Chuck Schumer have both expressed support for it over in the house passing any kind of additional funding for Ukraine is a very tall order there are Hardline
(14:41) Republicans who are against it that's why the administration says it's also putting border security funding in in this legislation according to officials and additional aid for Taiwan nonetheless it's still unclear with that Ukraine funding how much that's going to be easy for the house to swallow or not it's a tall order yeah and none of this happening in a vacuum this is of course all coming is the house still doesn't have a speaker and we're going to have more on that with Rachel Scott in just a
(15:08) moment but how could the lack of a house leader impact how this Aid gets out the door when it's approved well without a speaker of the house you can't bring bills to the floor for a vote which means you couldn't bring this Aid package to the floor for a vote you're also saying you're also hearing from Republicans rather who are saying they do feel increased pressure after that attack on Israel to get something done here but that pressure hasn't been enough I heard from Mike McCall for
(15:33) instance the chair of the house Foreign Affairs committee who said quote that this projects weakness and that the eyes of the world are watching the lack of a speaker projects weakness he says but Philly said that to me nine days ago and the house is nowhere near closer to picking a speaker than when he said those words that is amazing to think about Jay O'Brien on Capitol Hill Jay thank you so a world in disarray as the US entered day six 16 as Jay points out without a house Speaker Republican nominee Jim Jordan who has already lost
(16:04) two rounds of votes will be pushing for a third but the timeline is unclear right now all of this after Jordan's backup plan spiraled into a shouting match senior Congressional correspondent Rachel Scott with the chaos in Congress Jim Jordan tonight emerging from a tense meeting with Republicans saying he's going to take his bid for speaker back to the floor I'm still running for speaker and I plan to go to the floor uh and get the votes and win this race the about phase coming after Jordan's other plan failed he pitched
(16:35) giving the temporary speaker Congressman Patrick McKenry more power to buy himself time to change people's minds three hours of talks broke down into a screaming match I'm opposed to it and a lot of us feel the same way oh hell no no no no Hades no it all comes down to whether Jordan can convince more than a dozen Republican holdouts to support him it sounds like it got pretty heated in there well not me but a pressure campaign to make the hold outs flip has backfired some getting de threats but telling me it strengthens their resolve
(17:08) it's noise it's nonsense it shouldn't be accepted and it's not going to determine Jordan not deterred either if you don't get assurances from any of those outs will you stay in still and Rachel joins us now Rachel has Jim Jordan reacted to those threats and is he making any inroads do you know with his own party Phil I had a chance to ask Congressman Jim Jordan whether or not these threats against his colleagues are acceptable he said absolutely not that they are wrong and he's calling for
(17:38) them to stop but right now the math does not appear to change he tried to get all of those hold outs in one room tonight some skipped the meeting entirely others left unmoved now he says that he's calling for his conference to come together but it's unclear when the house will vote again Phil all right Rachel Scott from Capitol Hill Rachel thank you now to former president Trump and a surprise turn in the Georgia election interference case one of the codefendants and one time Trump lawyer has taken a plea deal Sydney Powell
(18:07) pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors here's ABC's senior investigative reporter Aaron kerki Sydney Catherine Powell she was at the center of Donald Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 loss publicly pushing outlandish claims of election fraud and privately meeting with the former president inside the White House but tonight just one day before her trial was set to begin Sydney Powell pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors Miss po do you understand the charges um that are against you here
(18:37) today I do howwell spread the false conspiracy theory Georgia election machines were controlled by Venezuela even pointing a finger at the country's former dictator Ugo Chavez who was dead this was exported from Venezuela and by Maduro and by Mr Chavez this is the consumate foreign interference in our elction elction in an oval office meeting on December 18th 2020 Powell allegedly suggesting Trump name her special counsel to investigate election fraud in that same meeting Trump and his team allegedly weighed seizing voting
(19:10) machines even declaring martial law as part of her plea deal Powell is now required to testify against her codefendants including the former president and Aaron joins me now Aaron was former president Trump surprised at all by this oh he and his legal team were caught completely off guard by Sydney Powell's guilty plea Phil in fact Trump is now scrambling to figure out how to respond his lawyer insists that this is good for Trump and part of his defense strategy all along Sydney Powell after insisting for a long time that voting
(19:45) machines in Georgia Were Somehow under the control of a dead Ugo Chavez is now going to serve probation in addition to her cooperation deal with prosecutors and Phil she also has to write a letter of apology to the citizens of Georgia Phil all right Aaron kerski in New York City Aaron thank you a new study tonight has scientists raising alarm Bells with warmer Waters fueling the intensity of hurricanes in the Atlantic according to a new report published today in scientific reports hurricanes are now more likely to strengthen more rapidly

(25:59) millions of Israelis the Iron Dome but how is the system able to stop Hamas Rockets midair who's funding it and how do residents feel about living under its protection our Brit clinet traveled to Israel's northern border to find out along Israel's northern border with Lebanon there are intense exchanges of fire as tensions escalate with Hezbollah an iranian-backed militant group and allly of Hamas we see New Israel Defense Force positions and tighten security Israel is preparing for the opening of a new
(26:38) front oh okay you can hear that that is that's outgoing fire from the Israeli side a response to these attacks this one was yesterday an anti-tank missile attack but just 15 minutes ago there was one not far from where we are now you can hear that was that was the impact that was the sound of the impact on across the border on the Lebanon side and they're firing again just yards away from that attack on the Israel moshav of stah which killed a local farmer we meet resident Ora hatan aren't you afraid no
(27:14) all the village all the citiz and lives everyone's left most of them yes most most of and I'm not I'm not afraid was that outgo that's impact so that's impact from Israeli fire so just behind that wall is Lebanon yes yes it's Lebanon we know the villages and you see the house is end of their it it'sa house Aura unflinching she's staying put with her 10-year-old son I think that once at all we have finish with you have to finish because because you know uh now if United State don't

(28:31) weapons rallying 360,000 reservists and Israel's protector the Iron Dome up against its biggest test yet in his visit to the war zone President Biden giving his full-fledged support for Israel promising to ask for additional funding for the Iron Dome including missile interceptors to replenish the air defense system the United States has already provided at least $3 billion for the Iron Dome to date we're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied so we can continue standing Sentinel over Israeli Skies saving
(29:08) Israeli lives the Iron Dome is one of the most important tools that Israel has in its Arsenal and with Israel at war never had to work harder could you explain uh briefly how it works well I can't elaborate into too much of the of the technology behind it but the idea of course is that the system is able to recognize and then inter ccept in real time rockets that are aimed towards the civilian populations within Israel and it's uh truly been a system that is a GameChanger the Iron Dome first operational in 2011 uses a sophisticated
(29:41) radar system to track those inbound missiles uh Iron Dome like any air and missile defense system has a couple basic components it's sitting and waiting for some threat to come into its field of view when it does it ascertains hey is this a threat is this a rocket or is this a Cessna and is this coming to threaten the area that I'm assigned to protect and if it does detect a threat the system can bring down Rockets fired from a range of 2 to 40 m away with Incredible accuracy Iron Dome has shot down thousands of these things over the
(30:15) years but can't it be overwhelmed anything can be overwhelmed if you concentrate your forces on a particular area they're trying to defend the whole country they're trying to defend neighborhoods all over the country and so by definition uh it's going to provide defense but it's it's still limited IDF spokesperson major Libby Vice tells me the Iron Dome is intercepting more Rockets than ever before 6,000 just within the first week of the conflict you could see more especially if you see Hezbollah get
(30:41) involved is it up to the task absolutely uh of course we understand that the coming period of time and the coming days will be very very challenging but the iron Don system and our other active air defense systems were designed exactly for for this Mission are you taking special preparations of course uh the system is one that's very responsive and the the soldiers here to the changing aspects of the operational reality on the ground back in ster on the northern border the Iron Dome will be needed aren't you worried aren't you scared
(31:16) doesn't that sound make you scared no why because me I'm protecting him oh because you're protecting him of course but I don't have gun nothing only you know only good day what only love yes love and war yes yes our thanks to Brit for that still much more to get to here coming up new developments in the case of the man accused of killing rapper Tupac Shakur why a key court date is now being delayed again but next President Biden addressing the nation from the Oval Office we're going to take a look at

(44:54) thought maybe we would try a relationship without marriage because that didn't work so well for us but then there was a point in time actually at a barn with our horses where he completely surprised me and proposed and so it was easy to say yes what made you fall in love with him and what aspect of him do you feel that if they were to know him they they'd also fall in love he's so thoughtful I mean he remembers everybody's birthdays remembers Ann nurseries you know uh remembers kids' names remembers your high school mascot
(45:31) and yours is the Fox right yes oh my goodness wow I am impressed had to look it up last night talk to me about John Deere and and working there for your first job yeah my my family was in the John Deere business uh I really started working there when I was in grade school I come from a very hardworking family and you know principles the same as my husband you know trust you've got to build trust with these Farmers because it's a generational transaction you've talked quite openly and often about struggling
(46:06) with alcohol and and addiction now 21 years sober do you remember the moment when you realized I'm an alcoholic oh yeah um I mean I actually knew when I was in college I would try to stop drinking and I and I couldn't there was a two decade struggle I never reached out for help or hardly because of the stigma of addiction but there was a point in time where I I guess I was suicidal at the end of my drinking and there was a point in time where I just I had faith that there is there's God uh but I wasn't part of an organized
(46:43) religion and I was out walking I always get emotional when I tell the story but um I just said if there's anybody out there I need help and and I've been sober since I uttered those words so you know that is was a miracle for me because I I spent a lot of years relapsing and you know and suicidal so I'm so grateful to be here today what got you to that point to to utter those words well it was the you know I was I had untreated depression um and alcohol is a depressant and so I mean to to I went to low depths I never
(47:25) thought I would be I knew that if I didn't do something you know cuz I had been to treatment and so yeah that you know it was kind of a miracle for me what ultimately worked you said you tried treatment before what yeah I um had a good friend who was an addiction counselor and she said you know you got to be with people that are like you and so I found this great group of like my tribe you know like this great group of people that were struggling with the same things I struggled with um we got together we
(48:00) spent a lot of time together we focused on faith uh service to others truth honesty you know all the things that are really important for being a you know uh a human being that um is of service and um honesty is a big part of that so I still have those friends today they're deep and uh they're deeply embedded in my life and dear dear dear friends the thing that Katherine has that is impresses me so much as her courage I mean her her willingness to put herself out there and tell her story is change lives and save
(48:36) lives I've seen it in action I've seen it in the work that she's done here in North Dakota and I have had so many people come up to me and share that with me about that that her courage has meant and inspired them I mean I love her more now than ever before because it's just uh so impressive that for people to have the courage today uh in today's environment to get out there and and do that do you still go to meetings I am involved in a community yes that is uh focused on supporting each other if you
(49:06) are to become first lady what would be your platform the Behavioral Health crisis um there's so much stigma around mental health brain health the disease of addiction we need more services we need insurance to change we need um stigma to be elim ated in healthare why do you think that Doug would make a great president of the United States because he's incredible leader I mean more than anything he's a leader in the community he's a leader in the business World he's a leader in philanthropy he
(49:40) knows how to bring teams together he knows how to unite people to solve problems he understands that success of our nation starts with one community at a time our thanks to Lindsey Davis and of course the bergam for that we want as we await President Biden's remarks from the Oval Office we want to bring in uh White House correspondent Mary Alis Parks who's in Washington right now uh Mary Alice good to see you what is the White House saying on what we can expect in the president's message tonight yeah
(50:09) Phil the president wants to make the case for American leadership in this moment he wants to explain why he thinks it is vital that the US support not only Israel but Ukraine and why that is important for our national interests it's going to appeal largely to those in Washington and around the country who instead recently have been inclined to step back from the world stage I think we know that he did talk to the Ukrainian president uh zalinsky today ahead of this speech the White House is working on a proposal for a major Aid
(50:39) package to bring additional funding to Ukraine as well as Israel and Phil I'm going to be listening for any mention of how to get Americans home especially out of Gaza not only including those who maybe are still held hostage but we also know that there are hundreds of US Passport holders ERS in Gaza who are still looking for a way out I mean Big Picture This is an incredibly politically risky speech for the president there is no guarantee that violence will not continue to erupt throughout the region and of course
(51:09) we've already seen those protests here in the United States people who are very concerned about the well-being of innocent women and children in Gaza and there's a risk right now that the president could look even more closely tied to any future Israeli air strikes or potential ground Invasion so with with such a risky speech that needs to be so precise do you know any more details about the aid package that he's going to be talking about I don't know if the president will get into the numbers the specifics we are hearing the
(51:39) White House could be prepared to ask Congress for as much as a hundred billion dollar now we expect the bulk of that will actually be for Ukraine the idea being that it would be aid for Ukraine uh for many many months maybe over a year but also it would include money for Israel as well as Taiwan Ian and potentially even more money to ramp up border security Now the US does already have security agreements that lets the US send billions of dollars in military aid to Israel but this would be even more and of course all of this puts
(52:09) a lot of public pressure on Capitol Hill especially on Republicans who right now are still fighting over a speaker and have stalling all potential legislation and votes all right Mary Alis Parks uh from Washington Mary thank you and Mary just mentioned Republicans on Capitol Hill so let's talk to him We're joined Now by Arkansas Republican representative french hill he is co-chairman of the Congressional task force on American hostages in America's wrongfully detained abroad Congressman thanks so much for taking the time with
(52:39) us on this night we know that there are American citizens among the hostages being held in Gaza have you been in contact with any of their families well bill it's good to be with you yes we have heard from a a family that has a a missing love one in Gaza and they're in touch with the state department there's some 12 Americans that we believe are missing and possibly held hostage there the United States has done an unprecedented strategy which is to take our hostage task force to uh Israel we have our assistant special Envoy there
(53:15) overseeing it and we're working with the Israelis to make sure that we can identify these Americans and bring them home yeah and it's such a complicated process because today Israel's defense min had this message for the troops there he said and we're quoted for you whoever sees Gaza from afar now will see it from the inside I promise you um with the hostages being held in Gaza do you support Israel going in on the ground and and and what what do you think that does um for getting the hostages
(53:48) back well Phil I think that's a very complex military operation you know the density in Gaza is about a I think around 5,000 people per square mile it's about the density of London England so this is a very highly populated area which makes Urban Warfare very risky and very challenging I'm sure the Israelis will take every effort to do that in the right way which is why they've urged people to move out of the north of Gaza but look Hamas is a terror organization Hamas has taken over and impoverished
(54:20) the people of the Gaza Strip they launched an unprecedented attack against the people of Israel the worst attack in 50 years more people were killed per capita than we saw in 9/11 in the United States when you adjust it for the Israeli population this is a stunning terror attack and I have no doubt that America will back Israel in their effort to go in identify the command and control of theas terrorists and remove them so President Biden is expected to request Congressional support for funding to Israel and Ukraine in his
(54:54) address in just a few minutes with the house leadership still unresolved will you be in a position to respond to any kind of request the president makes I believe that we will we'll work with the Senate we'll work with our colleagues and we'll find the path to First analyze the president's request compare it to the things that we've already approved in the house previously and we'll do that in the right way and find a way to support both the effort to eject Putin from Ukraine uh and defend
(55:22) Israel from this terrorist attack these are important priorities America is an indispensable leader in the world and I don't think President Biden has shown the kind of leadership that would be necessary to help the ukrainians win in Ukraine I think his message tonight is to really hone in on that point what's the strategy to win do we have the right weapons in place are we doing what we need because the Europeans have matched the Americans dollar for dooll and in some cases in the humanitarian space
(55:51) given far more housing including 4 million Ukraine Ian so we need to know that we need to stand by our allies and defeat Putin and by doing that we're also defeating in my view Iran which is the lead supporter of Hamas the lead supporter of Assad in Syria and the Drone manufacturer for the Russians so these are linked conflicts it's been reported that the president may ask for somewhere in the the ballpark of a hundred billion dollars if that comes before the house will you vote in favor of the president's requested spending
(56:22) for Israel and Ukraine well cly supported the work that we've done to help the ukrainians defeat Putin and eject them and I'll look at the request we have absolutely no information about the president's supplemental request and just two weeks ago we approved $3.3 billion for Israel for foreign military financing and $500 million for the US Israeli defense PCT was overwhelmingly passed by Republican votes and we've approved uh Ukrainian funding in the past as well I think what the house wants to see is is what's the
(56:56) strategy for victory in Ukraine what's the best way for the ukrainians to achieve that Victory and how do we partner with uh not only Europe but Freedom loving Nations around the world to make sure they have the resources to do that and have transparency about where that funding uh is how it's used and how it's accounted for and in Israel as I say the house is in lockstep we will support the people of Israel as they fight back against this terror attack all right and just because we have you and you are part of the caucus
(57:25) I've got to ask you right before we go I see the smile on your face you knew it was coming Jim Jordan doesn't have the votes he didn't have the votes once he didn't have the votes twice um if he can't get the votes do you have any other names of someone you would support well Phil I think the conference will decide that if Mr Jordan decides to withdraw his candidacy for speaker I believe our conference will get together and go in a different direction and look for additional candidates in the
(57:51) meantime we're able uh overseen in our efforts in the house house by the speaker protm Patrick McKenry of North Carolina all right Arkansas representative french hill really do appreciate the conversation tonight thank you and good luck with getting the American hostages home all right let's turn back to ABC's Jay O'Brien on Capitol Hill Jay let's stay on the speaker vote for a moment is there any sense that tomorrow's vote will have a different outcome for Jim Jordan uh no Phil the reality is no so Jim Jordan met
(58:22) behind closed doors tonight with their holdout votes there are 22 Republicans excuse me who on the second ballot did not vote for Jim Jordan yesterday and so some of those by the way some of those 22 holdouts I've been told they didn't show up to that meeting they were meeting with other people while Jim Jordan was trying to meet with them but there were some lawmakers that did show up um and every single one that emerged told me Jim Jordan didn't move their vote I talked to Carlos gim menz of Florida who said that Jim Jordan did not
(58:53) move his needle at all then and I talked to Mario Diaz bolar also of Florida I asked him did Jim Jordan say anything inside that meeting that would have turned him from a no vote essentially into a yes vote he stopped in his tracks in the hallway he looked at me and he said come on and that was his intonation and his point was that Jim Jin Jordan didn't move the needle with him at all so nobody came out of that room saying that Jim Jordan had gotten them from a no vote into a yes vote when Jordan walked out of that room I asked him if
(59:21) there was going to be a vote tonight because there was some scuttlebutt even Jim Jordan himself had indicated that there would be a vote tonight and he gave me this quizzical look and his assessment was that there wasn't going to be a vote tonight and certainly there isn't a vote tonight we're bracing for this vote tomorrow morning around 10:00 but the question becomes what does tomorrow look like that was any different from the last vote that was taken on Tuesday in fact Phil I've talked to some of the holdout votes and
(59:48) some Republican sources that are close to those conversations with the hold that votes who say their assessment is that their ranks might only grow in size between today and tomorrow so you had 22 Republicans vote against Jordan on the second ballot on Tuesday I've heard from some Republicans who expect that number could grow to as many as 30 meaning that Jordan not only hasn't moved any of the no votes into yeses they've actually grown in size as he's consistently had ballots and had voting all right Jay O'Brien from
(1:00:23) Capitol Hill Jay thanks so much keep talking to all of the uh Republicans in the caucus cuz we definitely are looking for an answer now it's I think day 16 uh without a speaker Jay O'Brien from Capitol Hill Jay thanks so much okay uh we are going to we're set we're waiting for the president right now we're about 10 seconds away from it it's a special report uh we're going to go to David M in just a second for the president's speech it's uh the White House lit up tonight in that color for
(1:00:55) breast cancer um David will be joined by members of our team Martha Raditz I know is going to join David from Israel um and now let's go to David and the president's speech this is an ABC News special report a presidential address to the nation now reporting David mure good evening we're coming on the air at this hour because President Biden is about to address the nation from the Oval Office speaking about Israel's war with Hamas and about Ukraine's war with Russia and America's role in helping its allies
(1:01:25) with these two conflicts now unfolding he is expected to call on Congress to pass a massive 100 billion foreign aid package tonight's address coming just hours after we learn the US has fired its first shots in defense of Israel the USS Carney taking down Rockets fired from Yemen in the direction of Israel the Pentagon tonight unsure of the intended target but the US taking action Israel signaling its ground war into Gaza is imminent the defense minister there in Israel telling troops today to be ready to Gaza quote from the inside
(1:01:57) the Israeli military unleashing Relentless air strikes on the Gaza Strip saying it has hit hundreds of Hamas targets now the president deeply concerned about the fate of more than 200 hostages held by Hamas of course Americans among them and the Urgent humanitarian need for Palestinian civilians caught in the middle President Biden and Egypt's President LCC brokering a deal to get desperately needed Aid to Palestinians through Egypt into Gaza the first trucks could get through tomorrow let's listen to the
(1:02:25) president addressing the nation tonight about these wars good evening my fellow Americans we're facing an inflection point in history one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come that's what I'd like to talk with you about tonight you know early this morning I returned from Israel I tell me I'm the first American President to travel there during the War I met with with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet and most movingly I met with
(1:02:58) Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October more than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel including at least 32 American citizens scores of Innocents from infants to the elderly grandparents Israelis Americans taking hostage as I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas we're pursuing every Avenue to bring their loved ones home as president there is no higher priority for me than the safety of American Self hostage the terrorist group Hamas
(1:03:34) Unleashed pure unadulterated evil in the world but sadly the Jewish people know perhaps better than anyone that there's no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others in Israel I saw people who are strong determined resilient and also angry in shock and in deep deep pain I also spoke with President obas the Palestinian Authority and reiterated the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people right to dignity and to self-determination the actions ofas terrorists don't take that right
(1:04:10) away like so many other I'm heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life including the explosion at the hospital in Gaza which was not done by the Israelis we mour in every innocent life l lost we can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity you know the assault on Israel Echoes nearly 20 months of War tragedy and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine people that were very badly hurt since Putin launched his allout invasion we've not forgotten the mass Graves the
(1:04:49) bodies found bearing signs of torture rape used as a weapon by the Russians and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken into Russia stolen from their parents it's sick Hamas and Putin represent different threats but they share this in common they both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy completely annihilated Hamas stated purpose for existing is the destruction of the state of Israel and the murder of Jewish people Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people Hamas uses
(1:05:22) Palestinian civilians as human Shields and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of them meanwhile Putin denies Ukraine has or ever had real statehood he claims a Soviet Union created Ukraine and just two weeks ago he told the world that if the United States and our allies withdraw and if the United States withdraw our allies will as well military support for Ukraine would have quote a weak left to live but we're not withdrawing I know these conflicts can seem far away it's it's natural to ask
(1:05:55) why does this matter to America so let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America's national security you know history has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their Terror when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos and death and more destruction they keep going and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep Rising so if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine he won't limit himself just to
(1:06:28) Ukraine he's Putin's already threatened to remind quote remind Poland that their western land was a gift from Russia one of his top advisers the former president of Russia has called Estonia lvia and Lithuania Russia's Baltic provinces these are all NATO allies for 75 years NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the Cornerstone of American Security security and if Putin attacks a NATO Ally we will defend every inch of NATO which it treaty requires and calls for we'll have something that we do not
(1:07:04) seek make it clear we do not seek we do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia are fighting against Russia Beyond Europe we know that our allies and maybe most importantly adversaries and competitors are watching they're watching our response in Ukraine as well and if we walk away and let Putin erase ukra Str Independence would be aggressiv around the world be emboldened to try the same the risk of conflict and Chaos could spread in other parts of the world in the indopacific in the Middle East especially in the Middle
(1:07:38) East Iran is is supporting Russia's UK in Ukraine and it's supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region and will continue to hold them accountable I might add the United States and our partners across the region are working to build a better future for the Middle East one where the Middle East is more stable better connected to its neighbors and through Innovative projects like the indiaan middle east Europe rail caror that I announced this year at the summit of the world's biggest economies more predictable markets more
(1:08:12) employment less rage less grievances less war when connected it benefits the people who would benefit the people of the Middle East and would benefit us American leadership is what holds the world together American alliances are what keep us America safe American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with to put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine we turn our backs on Israel it's just not worth it that's why tomorrow I'm going to send to Congress an urgent budget
(1:08:44) request to fund America's national security needs to support our critical Partners including Israel and Ukraine it's a smart investment that's going toay pay dividends for American Security for Generations help us keep American troops out of Harm's Way help us build a world that is safer more peaceful more prosperous for our children and grandchildren in Israel we must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and always the Security package I'm sending to Congress and asking Congress to do is an
(1:09:18) unprecedented commitment to Israel's security that will sharpen Israel's qualita military Edge which we've committed to the qualitative military Edge we're going to make sure Iron Dome continues to guard disguise over Israel we're going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreading look at the same time president Meto and I discussed again yesterday the critical need for Israel to operate by the laws of war that means
(1:09:53) protecting civilians in combat as best as they can the people of Gaza urgently need food water and Medicine yesterday in discussions with the leaders of Israel and Egypt I secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian assistance from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza if Hamas does not divert or steal this shipment these shipments we're going to provide an opening for sustained delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians as I said in Israel as hard as it is we cannot give up on peace
(1:10:29) we cannot give up on a two-state solution Israel and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety dignity and peace you know and here at home we have to be honest with ourselves in recent years too much hate has given too much oxygen fueling racism the rise of anti-Semitism Islamic phobia right here in America it's also intensified in the wake of recent events that led to the horrific threats and attacks that both shock us and break our hearts on October 7th Terror attacks have triggered deep scars and terrible
(1:11:05) memories in the Jewish Community today Jewish families worried about being targeted in school wearing symbols of their face walking down the street or going out about their daily lives and I know many of you in the Muslim American Community the Arab American community the Palestinian American community and so many others are outraged and harded saying to yourselves here we go again with islamophobia and this drust we saw after 911 just last week my mother was brutally stabbed a little boy here in the United States a little boy who just
(1:11:44) turned six years old was murdered in their home outside of Chicago his name was wadha wadha a proud American a proud Palestinian American family we can't stand by and stand silent when this happens we must without equivocation denounce anti-Semitism we must also without equivocation denounce islamophobia and to all you hurting those of you hurting I want you to know I see you you belong and I want to say this to you you're all America you're all America this is in a moment there you know in moments like these
(1:12:24) when fear and suspicion anger and rage run hard that we have to work harder than ever to hold on to the values that make us who we are we're a nation of religious freedom freedom of expression we all have a right to debate and disagree without fear of being targeted in schools or workplaces or in our communities I must renounce violence and vitory all see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans when I was in Israel yesterday I uh said that when America experienced the hell of 9/11 we felt enraged as well
(1:13:00) while we sought and got Justice we made mistakes so I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage and here in America let us not forget who we are we reject all forms all forms of hate whether against Muslim Jews or anyone that's what great Nations do and we are a great nation on Ukraine I'm asking Congress to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption so Ukraine can stop Putin's brutality in Ukraine they are
(1:13:39) succeeding when Putin invaded Ukraine he thought he would take keev and all of Ukraine in a matter of days well over a year later Putin has failed and he continues to fail Kei still stands because of The Bravery of the Ukrainian people Ukraine has regained more than 50% of the territory Russian troops once occupied backed by us Le Coalition of more than 50 countries around the world all doing its part to support Kei what would happen if we walked away we are the essential Nation meanwhile Putin has turned to
(1:14:16) Iran and North Korea to buy attack drones and ammunition to terrorize Ukrainian cities and people from the outset I've said I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine all Ukraine is asking for is help for the weapons Munitions the capacity the capability to push invading Russian forces off their land and the air defense system to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities let me be clear about something we send Ukrainian equipment sitting in our stock piles and when we use the
(1:14:52) money allocated by Congress we use it to replenish our own stores our own stock piles with new equipment equipment that defe that defends America and is made in America Patron missiles for air defense batteries made in Arizona artillery shells manufactured in 12 States across the country in Pennsylvania Ohio Texas and so much more you know just as in World War II today patriotic American workers are building the Arsenal democracy and serving the cause of Freedom let me close with this earlier this year I boarded Air Force One for a
(1:15:31) secret flight to Poland there I boarded a train with blacked out windows for a 10-hour ride each way to keev to stand with the people of Ukraine ahead of the one-year anniversary of their Brave fight against Putin I'm told I was the first American din a war zone not controlled by the United States military since President Lincoln with me was just a small group of security personnel and a few advisers but when I exited that train and met jinsky president zinski I didn't feel alone I was bringing with me the idea of
(1:16:07) America the promise of America to the people who are today fighting for the same things we fought for 250 years ago Freedom Independence self-determination as I walk through Kei with president sininsky with Aid siren sounding in the distance I felt something I've always believed more strongly than ever before America is a beacon to the world still still whereas my friend mine Albright said the indispensable Nation tonight there are innocent people all over the world who hope because of us who believe in a better life because of us who are
(1:16:48) desperate not to be forgotten be by us and who are waiting for us but time is of the essence I know we have our divisions at home we have to get past them we can't let Petty partisan angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation we cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win I refuse to let that happen in moments like these we have to remind we have to remember who we are we are the United States of America the United States of America and there is nothing
(1:17:24) nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together my fellow Americans thank you for your time may God bless you all may God protect our troops President Biden a rare public address to the nation from the Oval Office at the White House making the case that he will ask Congress for a significant foreign aid package $100 billion do to help support Israel an unprecedented help for Israel in their defense and also to continue to support Ukraine the president making the case that American leadership is what holds the world together he said
(1:17:58) American alliances are what keep us America safe and American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with he talked about these threats both Hamas and Vladimir Putin saying they are very different threats but he drew a parallel he said they both want to annihilate democracies right next to them he talked about the situation here at home talked about the anti-Semitism the islamophobia in Wake of what we're witnessing in the Middle East he said that must stop we must come together in the US and he also
(1:18:28) signaled out Iran supporting both Russia and Hamas and he said we will continue to hold them accountable I want to bring in our chief Global Affairs anchor Martha Ritz live in Tel Aviv with me again tonight and Martha this is a significant needle he must thread with two major conflicts now playing out in the world American leadership he argues is very important in this moment and he's asking Congress to act and he needs the support of of Congress he needs the support of the American people he was very passionate
(1:18:58) in that speech David uh remember he was just here yesterday flew straight home I know he had a very long day yesterday 8 hours on the ground here talking to Israeli leaders listening to them but he really did divide his time this evening between the conflict in Israel and the conflict in Ukraine he knows that the ukrainians are nervous and anxious because the world's attention has now shifted to Israel they are worried that they'll run out of ammunition and we've also David seen the Russians take
(1:19:32) advantage of this uh he really drove that home in the speech tonight David and Martha you do have late reporting from a US senior official about his meetings on the ground with Israel and his concern with this ground offensive that appears imminent he he is very concerned about that uh according to a Us official in those meetings uh according to this official the president was worried about the intense and deep anger of the Israelis he said it was nearly blinding he wants to talk to the Israelis continue to talk to those Israeli
(1:20:06) leaders and he did yesterday about using some caution how does this end what is it you want to accomplish that was the message of President Biden yesterday it is the message of President Biden today uh but they do believe that this will be a significant assault going forward David Martha rit's with us all week long here live from Tel Aviv Martha thank you with just a few moments left before we get you back to regular programming here on ABC one more question and this one goes to our chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce of course we're
(1:20:38) watching what's happening on Capital Hill Mar still they don't have a speaker of the house uh but the president will make this request of Congress both the house and the Senate a massive foreign aid Bill David we are told it is roughly $100 billion do including $60 billion for Ukraine roughly $1 billion for Israel although we are told that number is fluid it could be rising this proposal could actually be making its way to Congress as soon as tonight but as you mentioned for now it won't be going anywhere because the house remains
(1:21:09) at a standstill without a speaker that means no legislation can get through no work can get done now there is support for this kind of funding from both parties especially in the Senate but of course Congress has a lot of other pressing issues to get to including preventing another government shutdown in just a few weeks but David this is why the president was arguing tonight that this isn't an issue about some conflicts in Far Away places that this these fights these wars what we do next matters it's an issue of US National
(1:21:38) Security of Global Security and beyond that this is about what America stands for the president arguing we stand up to terrorists and we always defend democracy in the face of autocracy David Mary Bruce our chief White House correspondent we should mention that behind Mary the White House lit up in pink for breast canc cancer awareness and of course we can hear the voices the people on all sides of this as we watch this unfold in the Middle East making their voices heard just outside the White House grounds there Mary Bruce
(1:22:02) with us live Martha RIT with us live in Tel Aviv as well again President Biden addressing the nation a short time ago making the case for this $100 billion foreign aid package you will ask Congress uh for that help making the case that American leadership is needed now more than ever to help our allies of course talking about Israel unprecedented help for their Iron Dome and other defense capabilities and continued help he said for Ukraine and as I mentioned earlier saying these two threats very different Putin and Hamas
(1:22:32) but one thing is similar he said they both want to destroy democracies uh that are their neighbors I'm David mure in New York we continue with ABC programming here in just a moment good night this has been a special report from ABC News want to thank David and the team for that now we're going to get some more political reaction to the president's speech we are joined by Florida representative Maria Salazar congresswoman it's good to see you good to have you here what is your init initial reaction to the president's
(1:23:04) National address just now well the initial reaction is that we in Congress the Republican conference now we have a sense of urgency because as the president said he was going to be sending and probably tonight or tomorrow a100 billion doll B uh bill uh for Ukraine Taiwan and for for Israel so this uh makes the Republican conference have to think twice what is that we're going to do everything indicates that tomorrow at 10: we were going to go to another round of voting uh for uh Jim Jordan chairman Jim Jordan
(1:23:43) I'm not sure if he has been able to secure the votes that he needs in order to make it to 217 but apparently uh he is going to try once again again for the third time if that doesn't succeed and if he doesn't become the speaker tomorrow then we should look for other avenues and the only one that I can think of is to empower the uh the temporary speaker Patrick McKenry so then he can bring to the floor this package and we could help our allies those are the two scenarios that I see but uh this has created a sense of
(1:24:17) urgency for the republicans in Congress the president is asking for additional funds for Israel and Ukraine as both countries engage in war would you support increased funding on both of course we cannot abandon our allies the one that we had for one year and the new one that needs all the help and all the support if which is Israel so the the world has changed in a week we cannot abandon Ukraine because we know what happens if we abandon Ukraine Vladimir Putin will uh Bolden his energy and U next thing that we could see is
(1:24:56) Putin in Europe and then that will be a much larger and bigger war that we do not want to fight we have not lost one American soldier in Ukraine the Israelis are not asking for troops so the least thing we could do is send them the weaponry and the and the military equipment that they're asking for and we will have done our job and the $100 billion that the president is asking these are these are very um difficult times and we have to write up be step up to the plate and be up for the challenge that's the
(1:25:34) least thing we could do as you said we're an indispensable Nation we still are and we have to behave accordingly at the beginning of our conversation you mentioned the vote for a speaker uh in the house I'm wondering if you think your colleagues will back increased funding or will the Biden Administration you think have to come up with some sort of budget cuts to get the billions he wants for both countries well that's a discussion that we need to have and uh and because this news just came up I'm sure that we're
(1:26:07) going to be talking tonight as to if we agree with100 billion dollar but we do know that we have to provide our allies the monies that they need and I'm one of those members of Congress on the Republican side that we know that we need to put the money forth so we will not have to so this war war will not escalate specifically Ukraine Israel is surrounded by very bad people Hamas in the in the in Gaza Hezbollah in the north we have Syria and as we know Iran is behind all of this we have to send a very strong message with money and with
(1:26:48) resources to Iran and saying do not try to escalate this conflicts because you are the one who's going to wind up in a bad place but only the president and Congress can support that can support that idea that message and it's time for us to uh start working together with the president to join forces and send that message to someone that wants to destroy Israel and the Western world not only specifically us because that's something else that we need to uh uh keep in mind this is not a these are are not Regional
(1:27:24) conflicts this is part of a wider problem which is that Iran and all those China Russia North Korea and Iran they just want to destroy the West the way we live and the values that we live by you've recently co-sponsored a bill looking to give Israel an additional two billion for the Iron Dome defense system that's on top of the 3 billion already given for the Iron Dome system from uh the US what do you say to those who who say this humanitarian crisis in Gaza deserves the same level of attention well look um I I've always
(1:28:03) said that the Palestinians are as victims of Hamas as the Israelis are we know that Hamas invaded or penetrated Gaza in 2007 and from that moment on they have not allowed for the gazans or or the Palestinians who live in that strip to really be free to determine who they want to be governed by Hamas is a tyranny is a dictatorship and and the Palestinians are the women and children who are trying to escape and not be part of this Hass world they're victims one of the things that I've never understood is
(1:28:43) what where are the Arab countries where is Jordan where's Egypt why don't they open that southern border so everyone every pales inan men women and children that want to escape they can do so and go and go to Egypt I've never understood why if they are Muslim brothers and sisters what about Jordan what about Syria what about Lebanon what can they go there and Escape Hamas that's the double uh morality that we sometimes see in the Middle East so I don't think that we you can that you can conf flator that
(1:29:18) you can equate that Israel is fighting this War because of self-defense and Hamas is only trying to destroy Israel Congressman Salazar thank you so much for taking the time we we appreciate the comments of course thanks to you for the opportunity of course let's get to ABC News Chief Global Affairs correspondent now Martha Raditz who is still in Tel Aviv for us Martha you heard the president tonight touting America's role as a global partner for Israel and what's happening in Ukraine he also said he encouraged Israel not to
(1:29:50) be blinded by rage uh he's talked about this a lot being careful as they go into Gaza to eradicate Hamas your thoughts on that well according to a senior official I spoke to that is the feeling that President Biden got yesterday in some of those meetings that they were so angry and you can understand that anger you can understand what they have been through uh but the concern was where do they channel that rage and President Biden according to the senior official asks several times what the what the end
(1:30:24) how the end would look of this war what it is they wanted to accomplish and and there wasn't a lot of thought about afterwards there was a lot of thought about just going in and remember Phil what the president said yesterday about please learn from the mistakes uh that America made after 9911 when we were also filled with rage and and the actions we took after that that is the lesson I think President Biden wants the Israelis to learn despite the horrific things they have been through do not take the lives of innocent Palestinians
(1:31:03) uh because you are so understandably enraged by what Hamas did and Martha he also disclosed that secret trip to Ukraine in a in a 10-hour train ride from Poland that makes two visits into an active war zone for this president in the last nine months how unusual is that well in incredibly unusual quite frankly and and the most unusual thing of course about this trip was how public it was I have been on a couple of trips over the years into war zones with presidents one with President Obama one with President
(1:31:36) Bush uh into war zones they're usually incredibly secretive you can't say where you're going you you're not even really supposed to tell family that you're going out to On Air Force One to go to these places and President Biden publicly announced this uh obviously the trip to Ukraine was more secretive and he went on that train ride uh but I I can't imagine two trips to two War zones by one president yeah that's what we had yeah and I was struck by the same thing how public they made this particular
(1:32:08) trip as missiles are flying in that part of the world it was really remarkable and they are and they they are flying all right Martha radit from Tel Aviv thank you as always for your expertise chief White House correspondent Mary Mary Bruce joins us now from the White House and Mary before I ask you this question we heard uh during the Special Report with David there's obviously a protest near you so if people hear uh you know the bullhorn and people screaming that's what that is I'm curious what do you think of the the
(1:32:35) tone the president struck in tonight's speech well I think what really stands out first and foremost is just how unusual it is not only for the president to be giving a speech like this from the Oval Office but to hear any president tried to address two Wars in two separate countries two different parts of the world in one speech like this and yet he really was able to create you know this through line by saying that both of them while very different conflicts uh both of them are an instance of someone trying to annihilate
(1:33:02) their neighbor and he was able he tried at least to bring this back home and explain why these conflicts should matter to Americans why Americans should care about whether the US keeps up our support for these fights because as the president cautioned you know if you do not stand up to terrorists if you don't stand up to dictators it will only get worse the risk will only rise and the President also making an argument you know in a bigger sense about American leadership about American values about what we as a nation stand for and
(1:33:33) America's role you know on the global stage so certainly you know uh an unusual tone uh from the president unusual speech uh but but obviously some themes that we hear from him frequently pH and Mary what more can you tell us about that massive Aid package the president wants Congress to now pass we just heard from Congress Salazar Republican who spoke about that hundred billion number and seemed receptive to it yeah so so here is what we do know right it is roughly a hundred billion doar that includes $60 billion for the
(1:34:04) fight in Ukraine uh at least 10 billion for Israel although this is still fluid that number we expect could rise and this is all happening you know in real time this is a proposal that could actually be making its way to Congress as soon as tonight uh practically though uh while there is support on on both sides of the aisle especially in the senate for this kind of funding right now at least this request isn't going to be going anywhere and that is because of the chaos that we continue to see play out with Republicans in the house they
(1:34:32) still do not have a speaker and that means that all legislative business right now is at a complete standstill and when they do eventually get around to to to getting a new speaker and there is no end in sight to that at the moment unfortunately uh they do have you know a pressing to-do list in front of them including uh keeping the government uh from from preventing preventing a government shutdown which is l in just another couple of weeks and I think the president is also well aware that there is waning support uh not only from some
(1:34:58) in Congress but but from many Americans uh we've seen that in polling especially uh for keeping up the fight in Ukraine and that is why the president partly why he felt it was so important to come out tonight to speak directly to Americans in this rare kind of setting to make the case for why he feels it is so important that we not turn to Blind Eye to this that the US keep up its support for our allies Mary Bruce from the White House Mary thanks joining me now is congresswoman Kathy Manning Democrat from North Carolina
(1:35:26) congresswoman thanks for joining us do appreciate it um there were several asks from the president in tonight's Address given the unprecedented Place Congress finds itself in right now do you see any way the house gets together to deliver on the president's requests well assuming that the Republicans can actually elect a speaker I do think we will come together on this issue I think the president did a a wonderful job making his case to the American people explaining why it's so important for us to stand with both of
(1:35:57) our Democratic allies with Israel which was attacked by Hamas terrorists who invaded the country and and created appalling crimes going house by house slaughtering families uh killing more than 260 young people at an outdoor uh um concert and taking 200 people hostage I think the American people understand how threatened we felt uh after 911 and seeing what Israel has gone through hearing about the hostages many there are Americans among the hostage and there are Americans who were killed I think he made the case and I think the
(1:36:38) the Democrats and in fact the entire House of Representatives will stand with him he's also made the case on Ukraine and and the importance of standing with with another democracy so that they can defend self against this appalling Invasion by Putin and the Russians who have committed incredible atrocities against that country and I think he the president inspired us uh with his words talking about America as being a beacon for the rest of the world and reminded us how important it is for America to assume its its leadership position in
(1:37:14) the world you are a Top member on the house Foreign Affairs committee I'm wondering do you know if President Biden spoke with any top Democrats the gang of eight before delivering tonight's address I don't know but we did have a a markup in the Foreign Affairs committee today where we addressed a variety of issues that will uh send the right message to the terrorists and also send the right message to Iran because we know that Iran is the global sponsor of terrorism and was has been training and
(1:37:46) funding and supporting the terrorist group Hamas which caused this terrible these terrible atrocities in Israel and Iran is also the sponsor funer and trainer of Hezbollah which sits in Lebanon with 150,000 Rockets aimed directly at Israel and has been causing some skirm skirmishes across that Lebanese border so what we did in the Foreign Affairs committee today is passed a variety of bills that will send a strong message to Iran that they need to stay out of this conflict you have said uh this week I believe that the
(1:38:23) attacks on Israel need to be quote condemned by everyone those were your words talk to me a little bit about the messaging among some of the colleagues in your party well I think it's important for everyone to realize that the this was an unprovoked attack by a terrorist group and the slaughter of civilians the slaughter of women and children and the elderly um the terror that that these these uh that Hamas committed I mean they they found homes where people were locked in safe rooms and they literally set those homes on fire to smoke people
(1:38:59) out so they could then either slaughter them or take them hostage and I think it should be simple for everyone in the US Congress to condemn these horrific acts of Terror and we have seen this on both sides of the aisle we have seen these cond condemnations can you talk to me a little bit about the actions Congress has taken separate and apart from what the president asked in tonight's speak uh in tonight's speech in support of Israel and and what more you think needs to be done on that front well previously
(1:39:31) we have been strongly supportive of Israel in fact the last time Hamas attacked Israel which was I believe in June of 2021 we passed a a resolution or or or a bill rather to to supply additional funding to rearm the Iron Dome system and we passed that that uh additional funding I Believe by about 420 to n that was an extraordinary show of support for Israel in this past week while we have been waiting for the Republicans to uh to see the light and and uh elect a speaker so that we can do what the American people elected us to
(1:40:10) do and that is to do the business of the American people and also to stand with our allies around the world during this time while we've been waiting there have been a wide variety of resolutions s passed of resolutions drafted letters drafted showing our strong support for Israel so showing that we want to make sure that Israel does have what it needs to maintain its qualitative military Edge to rearm the iron doome system there have also been letters expressing concern about the way Hamas is terrorizing its own people the people
(1:40:46) who who it it was elected to govern and the and Hamas not only only puts the Israelis at risk but Hamas puts the Palestinians in Gaza as at risk by using them as human Shields and we know that Hamas puts its weapons its missile launchers its weapons caches in civilian locations in mosques in schools in uh in hospitals and by doing that they put their own people at risk we also know that as people have tried in in Gaza have tried to move out of the way of of of the expected Israeli attacks the the Hamas is actually blocked people from
(1:41:30) leaving and we have expressed in Congress our sense of concern for innocent civilians in Gaza just as we have been so concerned about innocent civilians in Israel Congressman Kathy Manning thanks so much we do appreciate the conversation it seems like there's some bipartisan agreement overwhelming bipartisan agreement on this issue thank you so much I believe there is thank you all right let's get back to Capitol Hill and ABC's Jay O'Brien Jay what do you think about the president's message
(1:41:59) tonight and how do you think that's going to play in Congress yeah that package as you heard Mary mention as you heard both of those members of Congress mention is likely on its way here to Capitol Hill tonight at the earliest potentially tomorrow but the reality is Phil as you've heard everybody lay out it's hard to get that through the house it's impossible to get that through the house frankly without a speaker of the house so there's broad bipartisan support as Mary mentioned in the senate
(1:42:25) for what we're hearing from officials that the White House is looking at we're hearing from officials and again these numbers are very preliminary we haven't seen text of any legislation yet but it's looking like a hundred billion dollar foreign aid package with about $60 billion again numers still in flux with $60 billion for Ukraine potentially $10 billion in it for Israel additional funding for border security as well that border security funding meant to make this legisl a little bit more passible
(1:42:52) in the House of Representatives which I'll get to in a second but the reality is the house doesn't have a speaker so they couldn't put that bill on the floor if they wanted to that bill is likely to pass in the Senate almost certain to pass in the Senate because it's got support both from the top Democrat in the Senate Chuck Schumer who's already said he's open to something like that and Mitch McConnell who even before the president offered this legislation said he was open to something of that nature
(1:43:16) linking funding for Israel to funding for Ukraine but over in the house funding for Ukraine in particular has been a nonstarter among some Hardline conservatives particularly marjerie Taylor green most vocal among them but Matt Gates is one as well and so those Republicans have said they don't want to back any additional measures that include funding for Ukraine and one of the reasons why you haven't seen Ukraine funding get to the house floor for a vote even if it would pass in the Senate is because speaker McCarthy didn't put
(1:43:46) it on the floor in part because of concerns about how those Hardline Republicans would react and so the administration is putting border Provisions in this package we're told from officials to again try to make passing something that has funding for Ukraine and it a little bit more palatable in the house the question becomes and what we're going to see the answer to potentially in the next few weeks if they can figure out who their speaker is going to be is is that enough to get it at least on the floor for a
(1:44:10) vote where it would pass and Jay let's talk a little bit about that because that seems to be I mean we just spoke to a a Democrat and a republican both in the house both agreeing with what the president said tonight both interested in seeing that package both interested in getting Aid uh to Israel and Ukraine um but there's still no speakers you point out we hear about this vote tomorrow at 10 o00 Jim Jordan is going for a third time uh when he lost more votes on the second pass than he did on the first yeah that's correct so the
(1:44:44) vote right now tentatively scheduled for 10:00 tomorrow although these votes have been pushed back and canceled in some cases or not taken place in others so Jim Jordan's plan today essentially was to go into a conference meeting and try to give additional powers to the temporary Speaker of the House Patrick McKenry that would give Jim Jordan time to essentially carry out the D Jim give Jordan rather to campaign as the nominee while speaker McKenry it carried out the duties of speaker of the house that plan
(1:45:13) didn't work out then Jim Jordan got behind closed doors with hold that votes tried to flip them from no votes into yeses and he failed in doing that that's the state play as he goes into this potential vote tomorrow Phil figuring the third time's the charm I guess all right Jay O'Brien thanks so much from Capitol Hill meantime we have so much more to get to including our trip to Israel's northern border to learn more about its Iron Dome defense system and the role it will play in this conflict

(1:51:02) little bit of sun just a little bit breathing more just a little bit smile little more a minute with I've been R through the strange pictures of myone like is so little bit of sun Good Morning America welcome back you've been hearing a lot about this over the last two weeks it is Israel's missile defense system a multi-billion dollar piece of technology that protects millions of Israelis it's the Iron Dome but how is the system able to stop so many Hamas Rockets midair who's funding it and how do residents
(1:51:46) feel living under its protection our brick clinet traveled to Israel's northern border to find out along Israel's northern border with Lebanon there are intense exchanges of fire as tensions escalate with Hezbollah an iranian-backed militant group and Ally of Hamas we see New Israel Defense Force positions and tightened security Israel is preparing for the opening of a new front oh okay you can hear that that is that's going fire from the Israeli side a response to these attacks this one was yesterday an anti-tank missile
(1:52:28) attack but just 15 minutes ago there was one not far from where we are now you can hear that was that was the impact that was the sound of the impact on across the border on the Lebanon side and they're firing again just yards away from that attack on the Israel moshav of stula which killed a local farmer we meet resident Ora hatan aren't you afraid no all the village all the citizen lives everyone's most of them yes most most of I'm I'm Not Afraid was that outgoing that's impact so that's impact from
(1:53:05) Israeli fire so just behind that wall is Lebanon yes yes it's Lebanon we know the villages and you see the house is end of their it'sa house Aura unflinching she's staying put with her 10-year-old son I think that once at all we have finish with you have to finish because because you know H now if United State don't want that we are fighting them but we you know we delay the problem Aura is one of the only residents left in this nearly abandoned Community the government telling thousands of people
(1:53:48) along the border to flee amid daily border strikes you know there was an attack down the road and yet you're here yeah you're not leaving no I'm not leaving but you can hear those those bangs the Rockets seem close Israel saying it's ready for any escalation adding logistical bases equipping battalions with additional weapons rallying 360,000 reservists and Israel's protector the Iron Dome up against its biggest test yet in his visit to the war zone President Biden giving his full-fledged support
(1:54:25) for Israel promising to ask for additional funding for the Iron Dome including missile interceptors to replenish the air defense system the United States has already provided at least $3 billion for the Iron Dome to date we're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied so we can continue standing Sentinel over Israeli Skies saving Israeli lives the Iron Dome is one of the most important tools that that Israel has in its Arsenal and with Israel at war never had to work harder could you explain uh briefly how it
(1:54:57) works well I can't elaborate into too much of the of the technology behind it but the idea of course is that the system is able to recognize and then Intercept in real time rockets that are aimed towards the civilian populations within Israel and it's uh truly been a system that is a GameChanger the Iron Dome first operational in 2011 uses a sophisticated radar system to track those inbound missiles uh Iron Dome like any air and missile defense system has a couple basic components it's sitting and
(1:55:27) waiting for some threat to come into its field of view when it does it ascertains hey is this a threat is this a rocket or is this a Cessna and is this coming to threaten the area that I'm assigned to protect and if it does detect a threat the system can bring down Rockets fired from a range of 2 to 40 mil away with Incredible accuracy Iron Dome is shot down thousands of these things over the years but can't it be overwhelmed anything can be overwhelmed if you concentrate your forces on a particular
(1:55:57) area they're trying to defend the whole country they're trying to defend neighborhoods all over the country and so by definition uh it's going to provide great defense but it's it's still limited IDF spokesperson major Libby Vice tells me the Iron Dome is intercepting more Rockets than ever before 6,000 just within the first week of the conflict you could see more especially if you see Hezbollah get involved is it up to the task absolutely uh of course we understand that the coming period of time and the coming
(1:56:25) days will be very very challenging but the iron Don system and our other active air defense systems were designed exactly for for this Mission are you taking special preparations of course uh the system is one that's very responsive and the the soldiers here to the changing aspects of the operational reality on the ground back in stuller on the northern border the Iron Dome will be needed aren't you worried aren't you scared doesn't that sound make you scared no why because me I'm protecting him oh
(1:57:00) because you're protecting him of course but I don't have gun nothing only you know only goodward only love yes love and war yes yes our thanks to Brit for that and that is our show for tonight I'm Phil lipof ABC News live is here for you all night with the latest news cont context and Analysis you can always find us on Hulu Roku the ABC News app and of course abcnews.
