(00:00) three weeks ago our world was shattered by an attack on Israel to every Israeli and every American touched by these barbaric activities we love you you have to understand that we love you and we're with you and we grieve with you we share your anger and we stand with you 100% okay 100 110 110% let there be no doubt The Killers responsible for this horrible Massacre will burn burn forever in the Eternal pit of Hell they're going to burn forever long time on that terrible Saturday morning the world saw once again that the
(00:41) conflict between Israel and Hamas is not a conflict between two equal sides this is a fight between civilization and savagery between decency and depravity and between good and evil there is no comparison between a group that worship worships death and a group that cherishes life and cherishes our nation every single life that is lost in this conflict is on the shoulders of Hamas Hamas alone it's Hamas alone and I think you have to really add in the word Iran Iran people don't want to talk about it there can be no sympathy no excuses
(01:25) and no escape from these monsters and we will uh we will will do what has to be done and yet Joe Biden's feeble First Act one of the worst messages I've ever seen sent out to bad people after more than 1,400 Innocents including over 40 Americans were murdered or kidnapped and uh think of this we immediately announced that we're giving Hamas 100 million do we're going to give it to them into Gaza but they take it 100% of it they don't take 90% they they take 100% Mark knows that better than anybody
(02:04) they take 100% And we give them money hand over fist and we've been doing that for many years and then a speech was made declaring that if you support Israel you must give billions of dollars for open borders in Ukraine in other words they want to wield it all together and you don't wield it together they have to all stand on their own unlike Biden he's terrible worst president in our history by worst president he's the worst president he's the most incompetent president when I'm back in the White House the United
(02:39) States will stand with Israel all the way 100% without hesitation without qualification and without any apology we're not going to be apologizing we won't be apologizing we're not going to be apologizing we will fully support the Israelis in their mission to ensure that Hamas is decimated and these atrocities will be Avenged they will be Avenged many ways they'll be Avenged I think even beyond what you're thinking about Joe Biden's weakness caused the attack on Israel pure weakness and incompetence
(03:18) everywhere he goes Biden's weakness provokes war and death because as history shows evil only respects one thing unyielding strength you've got to be strong otherwise they're going to be taking over and they're going to be doing things that you wouldn't even believe when I'm back in the White House America's enemies will now once again and they're going to know it that if you try to kill our citizens we will kill you we will kill you I told them all that we had no problem you know
(03:52) we had no problem 3 years ago we had no problem for four years nobody even this is Unthinkable I mean I just watch watch and see what's happening it's Unthinkable this couldn't have happened Mark couldn't have happened although you may be were more deeply involved than anybody but I don't think you even believed a thing like this could have happened Mark if you spill a drop of American blood we will spill a gallon of yours we do [Applause] not and we're doing it because we want to start peace we're not going to start War
(04:30) Wars but the wars have to be finished often times before the peace and if you don't do the wars the peace doesn't happen and if you're not going to be tough and ruthless like they are it's not going to happen we have to stop it we have to end it once and for all under my leadership we will not squander our strength by trying to build democracies or quicksand of like we try to do let's take over a country and let's make it into a democracy how does that work out not too good or turn Baghdad into Palm
(04:59) Beach Palm Beach doesn't work out too well but we will use American power to deter those who would harm our people
