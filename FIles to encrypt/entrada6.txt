(02:28) foreign [Music] well thank you thank you thank you it's great for me to have you here and today we're just the most evil and humans to be surprised by something to watch a corrupt Sydney president had his top political opponent arrested on Frank and
(03:32) fabricated charges of witching and numerous other presidents would be guilty in the middle of his presidential election in which he is losing very badly [Music] an election interference and yet another attempt to rig and steal a presidential election persecution like something straight highway fascists or communist Nation of the history of our country but perhaps even more importantly the president with a band of his closest thanks Misfits and marxists tried to destroy American democracy and better [Applause] president of the United States
(05:02) ever put forward in an American court of law in history and object has been used it has nothing to do with a former president legally keeping his own documents of this character is not it is not even mentioned in this ridiculous 44-page indictment under the presidential records act which is simple not Criminal s to have these documents the truth in the most important case every other subject known as the Clinton Fox case they including discussions of U.
(06:03) S military in Farmington Haiti discussions foreign conversations with the many foreign leaders at the time think of that sense and effects taken from presidential briefings discuss things with the Secretary of State conflict investment and much much more very big staff never even considered for a criminal prosecution based on the types he took you won the case Judge Amy Berman Jackson's decision States under the Sagittarius scheme established by the presidential records Act but the season to segregate personal
(06:58) materials from presidential records is made by the president during the president's hearing I'm in the president's soul to sleep any normal Administration even in opposing one would consider that to be the aid but not be corrupt Biden Administration the Sox decision as it's known also States quote the National Archives Administration will Now does not have the authority to designate material as presidential records and have the authority now it does not have the types in question and there are less any right
(07:45) Duty or means to seize control even though the president enjoys unconstrained authority to make decisions regarding the disposal of documents that's been constrained to make that decision neither the archivist nor Congress has the authority to veto the president institution the presidential represent does not control any mandatory or even discussingly Authority or the activists to do classify records under the statute this responsibility is left solely to the president of the United States sort of that that's the
(08:27) decision thinking more you know just think of it in other words whatever documents the president decides to take with him it is the right to do so it's an absolute word this is the law and that is something that people have never seen and it couldn't be more clear about it because we're destroying and this is why no other president even those who kept far more documents today has ever been even investigated let alone charged with a crime because the same indictment patrolled by the Bible Administration included stage
(09:17) photographs of boxes at mileage or many people have asked me why who wrote these boxes why did you wrap them the answer in additional Refuge Act is that these routines were containing all types of personal belongings many many things everything it can be seen in the picture where someone might be I wonder what might have been dumped one of the very neatly arranged boxes all over the floor they were full of newspapers breast slipping citizens and pictures thousands and thousands of White House pictures they put so many pictures
(10:06) [Music] and much much more I hadn't had a chance to go through all the boxes it's a long tedious setup takes a long time which I was prepared to do but I have a very busy life I've had a very busy life they make it more busy because you're always training and under these socks decision there seemed to be no rush because yet the season was long the other picture that was silver and you remember that one was angry and collect towards the photo stage by the FBI and those that rated putting documents all over the floor
(10:49) remember that's in this picture all over the confidential said presidentials and interstitutional things and it was supposed to be there and I'm like foreign nothing there was nothing there nothing new according to the presidential records act which was a big deal I was supposed to negotiate it was FBI agents I have security to observe it I gave them security tips of everything and it's laboring violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution
(11:52) which protects the right against [Applause] I must say I'm not the one who thinks it's Joe Biden in his corrupt Department of Injustice who I think they are above them all never before have been two standards of Justice in our country been more certainly revealed Joe Biden had jobs U.
(12:36) S president and even as a senator which was completely intuitive in living room of the mistake when they find out they actually thought it was impossible to be Biden said 850 boxes to the University of Delaware making the search very very difficult for anybody and he refuses to give them up and he refuses behaving so nicely anything which is Doctrine considering his family received so much money from China foreign there was no security in the door was
(13:55) left open most of the time it was open or one of those classified Authority is president Joe Biden is nice president had no Theory to declassify and no right to possess which is very very tough memorabilities yet nothing happens Hillary Clinton set up and illegal private server in their basement Union with a deliberate intention of violating public International pay for Police scandals at the Clinton foundations and classified incentive information on
(15:02) the message over some of it happened to me it looked into anything into his computer he didn't want to be in his computer and all of it was illegal because thankfully she was never president it's a big difference it's a little bit thank you happy birthday happy birthday nice birthday isn't it years
(16:47) when God Hillary then deleted 33 000 emails and different answer their congratulations with a hammer and then they said participating in abstraction we're thinking that that's called obstruction there's never been obstruction as Brave as there she did this in the sense of everything and that nobody did anything about it the FBI and the drj protected her did not participate did not use a grand jury it did not execute certain points and then the corrupt head of the FBI James Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would
(17:43) bring a case can you believe him and there was just one of many items Hillary Clinton broke the law and she didn't get indicted Joe Biden broke the law and in many other ways I am so sure it was not that one voted I did everything right and they indicted me but you know we're serving as a great example in the case of Bill Clinton's National Security advisor remember that Sandy Bergman he was caught stealing classified documents from the nation records they're big ones very important ones and putting them also in response and he
(18:30) destroyed them and cut the paper which scissors what Burger did was highly illegal but he was given nothing majority nothing nothing happened there were countless other examples Bill Clinton it was actually quite trending with him you better get to Michigan Bill Clinton lost the nuclear carbs and absolutely nothing was done George W bush White House lost 22 million emails a record can you imagine
