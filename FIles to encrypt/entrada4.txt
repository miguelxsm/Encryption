(00:00) [Applause] of our country [Applause] [Music] over the past 12 years Sportsmen has become one of the most respected things in the industry and as I saw just moments ago every single age of these beautiful boats is designed and built right here in South Carolina my very skilled South Carolina hand so I know what that means and proud South Carolina Hearts I want to thank Sportsman's owners Tommy Hancock and Brinkley Melvin as well as the CEO of South Carolina boating and fishing Alliance get us a Brennan not not danden get us

(04:34) the launch of our brand new Coalition Small Business Leaders for Trump thank you thank you very much great with your help we're going to win the South Carolina primary buy a lot we're up by about 50 points but we don't want to take it for granted Henry said never take anything for granted right but we're going to win that primary big you know we won the state twice by record numbers literally record numbers and uh we're going to do it again we did phenomenally here we've always done well
(05:07) here and we're going to do it uh at a level that nobody's ever seen so we broke the record twice we're going to break it a third time we're going to break our own record so less than five months from now we're going to defeat crooked Joe Biden we're going to take back our country and we're going to make America great again so we've come today to the perfect place to talk about how we're going to end the economic catastrophe known as bionomics you know he thought that was a good it
(05:41) was meant to be bad it was originally done in the financial pages to talk about how bad it was and he said oh I love the name I love the name so now he goes around and he talks about it like it's good it's really bad and I spoke to the incredible owners of Sportsmen and they were telling me so different now than it was just three years ago Sportsman and other boat Builders across the state exemplify the American manufacturing muscle incredible how big a boat business it is in this state that will help turn the Biden economic
(06:13) bust into another Trump economic boom that's what you had you had the greatest boom in history most successful economy in history under my leadership we built the greatest economy in the history of the world in fact we did it twice if you remember we had to do it twice and now we're going to do it a third time but it's going to be bigger better stronger than ever before ever before but we had the greatest economy in the history uh really of the world we have the we had and then covet came in and we
(06:43) had to do it again and we did a great job with covet nobody knew what the hell it was and we did a great job and then we handed it over after a horrible horrible we got many millions and more votes I was told if you got the same number 63 million you win easily and we got millions and millions will get the most votes of any sitting president in history and they say we lost the election I don't think so terrible terrible what's going on between bad elections and open borders what's going on to in our country and
(07:15) that's almost the least of it you could go through point after Point there's nothing good happening in four short years we passed the largest tax cuts and reforms in American history we cut more job-killing regulations your boat companies and every other company would tell you that than any Administration in history broke every record we slashed the price of gasoline down to a dollar 87 per gallon we created twenty thousand manufacturing jobs right here in South Carolina we delivered 140 million dollars to ensure
(07:51) that Charleston has the deepest water port on the East Coast Henry would drive me crazy sir we need that money right Henry he'd call me it's a sir we got to make that the deepest sport I was only surprised you say the East Coast don't you want to also include the West Coast that'll be next he's got that idea I can tell you but you do have you have the deepest on the East Coast now and it was a big deal and it was a great job and the governor did a great job in getting it done and everybody else who helped these are just
(08:20) a few of the reasons your boat building industry exploded and prospered like never before and it was all under President Trump and it was my honor it now generates over six billion dollars a year and employs 26 000 South Carolina workers think of that and I'm very honored to say that my last two years 2019 and 2020 were the best two years that South Carolina boat Builders and South Carolina business has ever had is that right Ed ever ever had every single major boat manufacturer in this state expanded their operations
(08:57) during the Trump Administration there wasn't one that went down even a little bit they all went big they went very big they couldn't make them fast enough when I left off his business was roaring like a 400 horsepower Mercury outboard motor I just looked at them they are seriously good looking but then the economy slammed into a pile of rocks known as crooked Joe Biden crooked Joe we used to call them sleepy Joe now we call them crooked Joe I took it away from crooked Hillary that was a good day when I took it she had the best day I
(09:30) think she celebrated that night now we call her beautiful Hillary she's a beautiful woman crooked Joe's inflation crisis has raised costs to small businesses like this one by more than 20 percent already and it's going much higher Biden's energy crisis has hurt sales by nearly tripling the cost to fill up a Sportsman's 355 gallon gas tank think of that three times higher soaring interest rates which is even a worse problem make vote loans much more expensive makes it very hard for people to buy boats and all of this horrible
(10:06) stuff is happening against your incredible American worker under Biden household incomes have been crushed by nearly seven thousand four hundred dollars a year does anyone know that Marjorie did you know that under Trump incomes increased by more than eight thousand dollars a year with no inflation we didn't have inflation a vote for crooked Joe Biden is a vote for inflation taxation submission and failure it's what it is a vote for Trump is a vote for more jobs higher wages and more boats cars trucks
(10:42) and airplanes stamped made in America and made in South Carolina here are some of the first steps I'll take to rescue our workers manufacturers and small businesses from the burning wreckage of biodynamics as soon as we get back into the Oval Office we got to get back first I tell you if we don't get back I really believe this country is finished I really believe it I hate to say that it's horrible and Marjorie is nodding her head and Henry's nodding his head so I can't be the only one that thinks that but I
(11:14) think this kind I think this country will be finished they're destroying our country so stupidly so evily to rapidly reduce inflation I will end Joe Biden's war on American Energy and reclaim energy Independence three years ago we were totally energy Independents heading over to energy dominance right Russell for our next term I've set the ambitious goal of achieving the number one lowest cost of energy and electricity anywhere in any major industrial nation on Earth and we'll be there within six months
(11:50) in other words we will drill baby drill we're going to be drilling we're going to be drilling like we were doing before decades politicians like crooked Joe viciously betrayed South Carolina workers you know that look at what's happened you stayed in the last few years short time ago you had the best numbers you've ever had and now they're rapidly coming down rapidly rapidly like nobody's ever seen before has nothing to do with you it has to do with people that are very stupid people
(12:19) and I think very evil people in the White House your State lost one in three manufacturing jobs after Biden supported the NAFTA disaster in China's entrance into the WTO that was a long time ago but it showed us thinking it was a disaster the World Trade Organization a disaster China took advantage of everybody for years I've been speaking about it for a long time and I did a lot about it when I got into office China paid us hundreds of billions of dollars not one president got 10 cents from John I got hundreds of billions of dollars
(12:50) from China they weren't too happy with me hence the China virus if we're up to Crooked Joe Biden every single job here at Sportsman boats would be shipped off to another country Biden puts China first Mexico first Ukraine first Europe first Asia first illegal aliens first above our great veterans you know that puts the illegal aliens above our veterans our veterans live like hell and uh you know what you see what's happening you ever see the illegal aliens that won the weirdest thing they come in by the tens of thousands
(13:29) sometimes a day and they all have they have cell phones I'm saying where do they get the cell phones everybody has a cell phone they're all talking in these beautiful cell phones and they're expensive ones too they're nice ones somebody who's into that said those are good phones and then I say who who pays their bills who's paying the bills Margie do you want to check that I'll give it to Marjorie she'll figure that one out fast no but you ever notice they're all coming in with cell phones
(13:57) our veterans don't have cell phones do they but they put illegal aliens first and everyone first but he puts America last he puts our military last he puts our veterans last he puts workers last he puts small businesses less he puts everything that's good and proper last he puts it last it's crazy I put America First every single time every single time [Music] Mexico and Canada the best trade deal ever made in this nation although I must tell you my deal with China was very good too but I don't talk about it
(14:40) because of covet I that was a step too far but we did the USMC and they're trying to renegotiate Mexico and Canada trying to renegotiate it now because the deal turned out to be so good for us and I wouldn't do it we suffered with NAFTA for many years for decades we didn't renegotiate it we should have we didn't to further create a Level Playing Field for our workers and small manufacturers and our next term I will impose across-the-board tariffs on most foreign made Goods that's going to let your
(15:09) businesses compete I'll also pass the Trump reciprocal trade act in other words if China or any other country makes us pay a 200 or 300 or 100 percent tariff we will make them pay a reciprocal Tariff of the exact same amount and we're all set to get that done and then we got hit with coven I will revoke China's first and most favorite Nations trade status they have a most favorite Nation because they're a developing country the way I look at our country we're a developing country too because our country's gone
(15:48) to hell and we will oppose if penalties on China and any other trade cheaters and abusers and we did that at a level that nobody's ever seen you know I gave 28 billion dollars to the farmers of our country some of you got that that's why he said I'm never going to lose Iowa I'm never going to lose Nebraska I shouldn't be so confident right Marjorie but I said how are they going to vote I got the farmers 28 billion from China nobody ever got nobody even thought of doing that did anybody think they thought you think
(16:17) Biden says let's see how can I get some money from China for the farmers no he wants to get it for himself I will also resume our historic regulation cuts and get Washington bureaucrats out of your wallets out of your lives and out of your businesses in just one example of crooked Joe's extreme regulatory attacks the Biden Administration is right now trying to bludgeon the Boating and Maritime industry we were just discussing it with a lot of boat companies back there that create a lot of jobs and having a hard
(16:48) time with a boat speed limit of less than 11 miles an hour about 10 miles an hour in other words like a slow golf cart it's like a think of it along the entire Eastern part of our country this is supposedly in the name of preventing whale strikes but you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than hitting a whale with your boat there has only been listen to this one such whale killed off the coast of South Carolina in the last 50 years but on the other hand their windmills are causing whales to die and numbers never seen
(17:27) before nobody does anything about that they're washing up a show I saw it this weekend three of them came up they wouldn't you wouldn't see it once a year now they're coming up on a weekly basis the windmills are driving them crazy they're driving they're driving the whales I think a little baddie and they're washing up unsure at levels never seen before and they want to stop your boats one in 50 years can you imagine that the by the speed limit will demolish the charter fishing business
(17:57) Crush boat manufacturers and desecrate your cherished Low Country Traditions gonna desecrate those Traditions that's why today I'm announcing that when I'm reluctant on day one I will cancel Biden's ridiculous speed limit regulation day one day one first thing we will take care of the whales but we will also take care of the workers the boaters the fishermen of South Carolina will take good care of them all of them including the whale for that reason I will also rescind and revise Biden's absurd restrictions on
(18:33) recreational fishing including red snapper and bottom fishing you know what I'm talking about right you know what that means Henry I don't know do you are you a fisherman Henry he knows what I mean but we'll take care of that stuff all in that first period of a day or two maybe I'll need three okay we have to get it written up okay but we're going to get it done like day just about day one we will not allow crooked Joe to destroy the South Carolina way of life it's an incredible way of life it's a culture a
(19:03) beautiful way of life it's no wonder that far left lunatics are getting desperate to stop our Movement by any means necessary as you know crooked Joe and the radical left thugs of weaponized law enforcement to arrest their leading opponent me I'm their leading opponent I'm their only opponent on fake and phony charges I went through a whole life I never heard the word indictment all of a sudden every day I'm getting indicted in fact I'm getting a little concerned because we had a poll this weekend that was so big I said um
(19:33) here we go more indictments every time we get a good poll we get indicted this is high-level election interference and it's happening for a single reason because I'm the only candidate they do not want to run against you know they talk misinformation disinformation they're close enough you know somebody said what's the difference I said I can tell you the difference but they're very close but they're very good at misinformation disinformation they say they see Trump is leading by 55 points
(20:02) think of that and leading leading by 10 points against him The Washington Post ABC 10 points that's a lot you know because it's like considered a lot it's hard for Republicans to lead by that much in the fake news media the fake news media doesn't want to do that but but when they see these numbers they get crazy but we're leading by Rhonda sanctimonious we're meeting him by 56 points you know it's amazing in yesterday's NBC News poll I'm leading all of the Republicans and numbers like nobody's
(20:38) actually seen before and we're at just about 60 percent already and we're going up and we're the only ones going up they're going down they're going down down down they ought to stop wasting their time you know they're wasting a lot of time on this ridiculous debates that nobody's watching their last debate was the lowest rated debate in history that's a good compliment isn't it and what was I doing Audrey I was someplace else wasn't I huh I was doing another interview we had 271 million people listening to
(21:08) the Tucker Carlson interview that's at all you know what the second was it was Oprah Winfrey interviewing Michael Jackson that was 15 years ago we beat him by 150 million that's a lot I'm also beating Biden in the general well DeSantis and all of these other people are losing and they're losing big and in the new South Carolina poll I'm way up close to 51 or 52 and we're beating your former governors not nearly as good as your current governor by the way and we're being not even close by the way
(21:46) and we're beating everybody by a lot I mean it's just been an incredible thing and I just want to thank a lot of the people sitting up front some of them are such good politicians that have helped me that they're way in the back they're not sitting up front they don't want to be up front Russell they want to be in the back I don't know I think they're pretty good politicians too but we're uh I just want to thank everybody here and everybody all over because you've been incredible
(22:09) because it's important that we win you know the way you really win they cheat like hell that's all they're good at is cheating and elections that's the only thing they do well they cheat like hell and the way you win is you got to swamp them there's a point in which the cheating doesn't work and we're gonna have to swap them they rig the presidential election of 2020 and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. not going to allow no we're not
(22:34) going to have a country every time the radical left Democrats marxists Communists and fascists and that's what they are every time they indict me I consider it a great badge of honor [Applause] I'm being indicted for you thanks a lot I appreciate it [Applause] thank you for that to call our great first lady they love Melania I have to call Melania Melania and I have to call my kids I say kids and Melania listen got a little thing we're going to be indicted I'm going to be indicted tonight what four did absolutely nothing nobody
(23:14) knows do you ever see the reviews the legal reviews of these indictments they say these indictments are ridiculous every single one of them he he protested the election what about Hillary Clinton and everybody protesting the 2016 election what about all of those crazy radical left Democrats they're still protesting now they're keeping a little bit quiet you know they're going a little bit lower never forget our enemies want to stop us because we are the only ones who can stop them they want to take away my
(23:45) freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom that's true I will never let them I don't care I don't care I will never love you they want to silence me because I will never let them silence you and in the end they're not after me they're after you I just happen to be standing in their way unfortunately for me but fortunately for you together we have fought for this country like no movement has ever fought before you know this is the greatest movement in the history of the United States
(24:15) there's never been a movement call it whatever you want you know if you said what does Maga stand for I guarantee you he couldn't ask he couldn't answer I said Maggie means make America great again I guarantee if you said Mr Biden explain to me what does Maga mean what does it mean he was uh radical radical no it means make America great again we want to make America great again and now we have to do it all over again because they've destroyed large pieces of what we did we created the most secure Border in the
(24:53) United States history and built nearly 500 miles of border wall when I said to Mexico you will pay for the wall they largely did because they supplied Us free of charge 28 000 soldiers on our border free of charge that's a lot more than the cost of the wall I said no that's an easier way of doing it there was hardly a mechanism for them to pay for the oil but I said you'll pay for the soldiers and we had the best water the safest Border in history now we have the worst order in the history of the world
(25:24) there's never been a country with a border like this not even third world countries not even banana republics no country would allow this to happen to them no country we appointed over 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court Justices I fully rebuilt the United States military by the way much of it coming from South Carolina we created space force which everybody fought me on we got it done that was a big deal defeated Isis we defeated Isis remember that everyone said everybody said you can't do it
(26:03) Marjorie you can't do what they said Marjorie you know that everybody was saying you can't sure it'll take you years to do that I did it in two months because we have the greatest military in the world not these characters that go on television and not the people that did this horrible horrible most embarrassing event in our history Afghanistan the most embarrassing event ever we have great great military they wiped it out in less than a month we hit him hard I'll never forget sir we can have it done in about
(26:33) four weeks I said you gotta be I flew to Iraq remember and I came back remember that brave flight when we landed on a Runway with no lights and I said I want the Congressional Medal of Honor for myself I said am I allowed to give myself the Congressional Medal of Honor Russell and they said I don't think that would look too good sir I said I agree with you on that when I was the first president in decades who didn't start a war remember crooked Hillary now it's beautiful remember when uh beautiful Hillary said
(27:03) he's going to start at work because of my personality I said no my personality is going to keep us from fighting in wars and that's what happened Russia and Ukraine would never have happened China would never be talking about Taiwan would never Russia so said millions of people killed I think when you find the real numbers you're going to find they're much higher than anything that's being reported when you lock knock down those massive apartment houses and they say nobody was injured nobody was hurt there were no deaths
(27:32) they're lying to you millions of people are dead would have never happened those cities and those cultures are all destroyed you can never rebuild them can never rebuild them certainly not the way they were but all of that was just the beginning here's just some of the agenda we will immediately Implement when we become we we we're going to become the 47th president of the United States I will totally obliterate the Deep State we started we fired Comey we got rid of a lot of scum before I even arrive at the Oval Office
(28:06) shortly after I win the presidency I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settle it's going to be settled I know them both it's going to be settled quickly it'll be done very quickly and I'm the only candidate who can make this promise to you I will prevent World War III and we're a lot closer than anyone knows we are a lot closer to World War III than anyone knows and that will be a war like no other that will be obliteration this is an army tanks going back and forth shooting at each other this is
(28:38) Weaponry like nobody can even imagine you don't even want to talk about it on my first day back in the white house I will terminate every open borders policy of the Biden Administration and begin the largest deportation operation in American history and I will also use title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all traffic children to their families in their home countries and that will be done immediately they want to go home they want to go home horrible what they've done to children
(29:15) on day one I will sign a new executive order to cut Federal funding for any school pushing critical race Theory transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial sexual or political content on to the heads of our children and I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or mask mandate no mandates I will immediately close the Federal Department of Education and we will move everything back to the states where they can individualize education and do it with love for our children you know we spend a fortune in education
(30:03) we spend more than any other country in the world by far it's not even close and we'll ask at a 40 with 38 37 sometimes even 40 we'll ask so we spend sometimes three times you have Denmark you have Sweden you have Norway you have China it's at the very top of the list a lot and we're like last and yet we spend two and three times more money per pupil than they do we're going to end that South Carolina will run their own do you like that idea Henry you'll do a great job if you have
(30:32) the right people you're going to do a great job it can't be worse than what's happening right now so many people in Washington building after building we need maybe two or three people just to make sure they are teaching English in our schools say uh is everybody teaching English okay you qualify I think South Carolina as an example in particular a place like South Carolina would do an unbelievable job with education and they do it with love I will keep men out of women's sports I've been talking about this for so long
(31:03) and I will sign a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states can you imagine can you imagine if that can you imagine even saying that having to even say child think of it I was thinking the other night I was making a speech I said I will not allow child mutilation Charles mutilation the word is such a horrible word and we won't allow it in our country and can you imagine saying that 10 years ago people would say what the hell is he talking about and actually today it's a big they utilize I
(31:36) mean they want to they mutilate they want to mutilate your children these people are sick just as I did for four years I will fully uphold the Second Amendment they gained no traction they're gaining traction now playing with your bullets your ammunition they're gaining a lot of traction right now but you know keeping Men by the way just to go back keeping men out of women's sports it's the craziest thing I've ever seen and you have to look at some of these records a great one is weightlifting where for years and years
(32:08) 18 years this record stood and he had this great female athlete she was going to break the record of parents with her they were all so happy they're so proud and they put like a quarter of an ounce on each end right and she went up and up and up huh and she didn't make it then a guy comes on stage he just became I guess female right is that a correct statement he just became female he lifted that sucker I think broke the record by like 140 pounds one eighth of an ounce on each side he broke the record by 140 it's not
(32:43) going to be broken anytime soon maybe in a million years from now if we're still around because we have stupid people here that will allow everything to be obliterated don't kid yourselves and I will secure our elections because our elections if you don't have great Free Fair elections and you don't have borders you don't have a country and right now we don't have much of a country we'll laugh at all over the world our goal will be one day voting with paper ballots and voter IDs very simple
(33:10) one-day voting paper balance photo writing but until then we have to make sure we win we have to literally swamp them we have to swamp them we have to get so many votes out that they can't cheat because they will cheat and they will do things that Republicans don't do they are very very bad people in so many different ways this is what we must do in conclusion to restore our country to Greatness the USA is a mess our economy is crashing inflation is totally out of control China Russia Iran and North Korea have formed together as a menacing
(33:49) in just a horrible menacing and destructive coalition our currency is crashing and will no longer be the world standard which will be our greatest defeat in 200 years our currency will no longer be the world standard look at what's happening all these countries are going over to the one that's China what they're doing to us I'll get that stopped in one day I'll say you get that stuff that we're not doing any trading with you there'll be no more trading there'll be oh we would love to stop that we would like to
(34:20) stop that but nobody talks to them properly it won't happen with me not even a little chance just like Russia would have never invaded Ukraine as I said and China would not even thought about Taiwan and you know what he just said it they didn't they didn't there was never a thought and I I'll tell you what that was the apple of President Putin's eye I spoke to him very well I had a great relationship with him it's good to have a good relationship you know the fake news look at all of them back there the
(34:48) fake news said he gets along with Putin getting along is okay but you know in many respects uh he told me this he said there's never been anybody that treated us I ended North stream too nobody knew what Nordstrom to they never heard I ended the single biggest most important economic development in the history of Russia I ended it it was over when Biden came in in one week he approved it is that correct Marjorie one week he approved it I said I can't believe it and they built it one week and then they
(35:18) say Trump is very soft on Russia I was the one to put the big sanctions on and uh actually Putin once told me he said you know if you're really good to me like they say I'd hate like hell to see you if you were bad to me because there's never been anybody that does but we did get along and he would never have done that and he wouldn't have done it for a second reason oil would not have hit a hundred and ten dollars a barrel so he wouldn't have been able to afford Prosecuting the war he wouldn't have
(35:47) been able to do it because oil went up to a hundred dollars and a hundred and fifteen dollars and even more than that for a period of time and he actually made a fortune one of the few people ever to make a fortune on a fighting a war war you lose in lives and you lose money he lost lives but he made a lot of money and if that would have been stable if that would have been at forty dollars fifty dollars sixty dollars a barrel he wouldn't have been able to even do it and he never had the soldiers up there
(36:14) he was never even thinking about doing it with me he wouldn't have done it because I told him not to I said you have no idea what's going to happen to you if you do it but he wouldn't have done it because of the oil prices because oil was so low that's why a dollar 87 a gallon and it was even lower than that for a period of time we would have left Afghanistan with dignity and strength and pride instead of our greatest embarrassment in history I think Afghanistan was the greatest embarrassment in history and I actually
(36:42) think that's why Putin went in when he saw the incompetent stupid people the way they left they took the military out first I think Putin said these people are really stupid that's a different country than I've been dealing with for the last four years now this is our time to go in I really believe that's the third reason if you took the five worst Presidents in the history of the United States and added them up they would not have done near the destruction to our country as crooked Joe Biden and the
(37:07) Biden Administration have done you wouldn't have done there's nobody you could take your five worst Presidents add them up I may have to change it to 10. because five is no longer appropriate because you can't even get close I think I'll go to 10 from now on would people remember that please we're a failing Nation We're a nation in Decline and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere with our elections by using law enforcement it's totally corrupt and we can't let it happen that's why you must show up to
(37:40) vote in the first you have to just you're the first in the South primary do you ever hear that term first in the South you know that Russell is that a big deal I guess right I kept you there so you should be a big deal I think I'll take credit it's a big deal but it is a big deal you highly respect it as a state get everyone you know make sure they're registered to vote and get them out on Saturday February 24th it's a big time think of it it's less than four months before the season starts we started in Iowa we go
(38:13) to New Hampshire we come down here you know the beauty was when I came here everyone thought Bush was going to win and then they took a poll and they found out Trump was up by about 50 points everywhere and said what's going on right here they thought bushka's Bush supposedly was a military person great you know what he was in Miller he got us into the uh he got us into the Middle East how did that work out right but they all thought that bush might win Jeb remember Jeb he used he used the word jab he didn't use the word Bush I
(38:39) said you mean he's ashamed of the last name and then they immediately started using the name Bush never forget it but we came here and everyone thought remember he brought his mother here his wonderful mother she was 94 years old and it was pouring and they're Wheeling her around and it's raining and horrible I said who would do that to your mother at 94 years old how desperate are you to win but we we beat him by like 40 points and we went on to a lot of Victories we won in well we won in New Hampshire big we won
(39:06) here bigger we just went in and cleaned out the slate and then 2020 we did uh we got about I guess a hundred percent of the vote and now we're at levels that nobody's ever seen before with competition nobody's ever seen the levels that we're at now and most importantly we're at levels against uh crooked Joe that nobody's seen because you just don't see that with Republicans they have certain advantages as you know they have a certain areas of the country that regardless of good or bad they want
(39:35) to vote for these people I think they I actually think they're changing their tune also because nobody nobody can want to vote for this guy nobody and maybe he makes it to the gate I don't know if he makes it to the gate I don't think it even matters anymore because they have been so destructive to our country what they've done as a party that I don't even think it matters who are they going to put in a guy from California that's destroyed that state they're going to put in Kamala Kamala
(40:03) actually our numbers are better against Kamala than they are against Joe so maybe we'd like Kamala too but 2024 is our final battle with you at my side we will demolish the Deep State we will expel the warmongers get them all out of our government we will drive out the globalists we will cast out the Communists the marxists the fascists and we will throw up the sick political class that hates our country we will route the fake news media those people right there they're fake so many of them [Applause]
(40:37) you know when the Washington Post ABC came out with their big numbers that I was leading by 10 points do you know that ABC wouldn't put the numbers on do you know that ABC and the Washington Post said this must be an outlier meaning the numbers that they spend millions of dollars on polling the numbers must be wrong it was that Paul and that I watched they didn't want to put the numbers on so they covered the minor numbers underneath but they didn't want to put the numbers on and they didn't now these are corrupt people we will
(41:11) evict Joe Biden from the White House we will continue and we will finish the draining of the swap once and for all the great silent majority is rising like never before and that is happening I've never seen I've never seen Spirit or enthusiasm like we have this time more so than 2020 more so than 2016 and we had a lot we had it in records but it's never because now they see how bad these people they're evil they're sick and under our leadership the Forgotten men and women will be forgotten no
