(00:00) five Wars five wars in the last 15 years between Israel andas how do we end the current one and prevent a sixth war from happening sooner or later how do we balance our desire to stop the fighting with the need to address the root causes of this conflict and here is the sad truth and it really is a very sad Truth for 75 years diplomats well-intentioned Israelis and Palestinians and government leaders all over the world including presidents of the United States have struggled to bring peace to this region and during that time among many
(00:57) other things an Egyptian president and an Israeli Prime Minister were assassinated by extremists you know why because they tried to bring peace to the region this is an incredibly difficult and complicated issue and nobody has any simple solution to it mam president is one of the first members of Congress to call for a humanitarian and pause to the bombing I have been very encouraged to see that pause finally happen over the last five days and to see its extension earlier this week that is a very positive de development this temporary
(01:47) cease fire has brought some relief to Gaza and to the families of the more than 100 hostages released so far the break-in fighting has let an a average of 200 trucks per day to entag Gaza carrying desperately needed food water medical supplies and the fuel necessary to distribute Aid pump water and run hospitals and bakeries while this is only 40% and people must recognize this before the war there were 500 trucks coming in today now there are 200 it is still a very substantial improvement over where we were a few weeks
(02:35) ago Madam president it seems to me that our job now is to keep working to extend this window further and to get more Aid in and to get more hostages out more Aid in more hostages out right now critical talks are underway that will hopefully provide the United Nations the the time it needs to establish a sustained humanitarian operation that can meet people's basic needs and provide shelter and medical care and let us be clear the needs in Gaza are Beyond enormous mam president for those of us who want not only to bring this war to
(03:24) an end but to avoid future ones we must first first be cleare eyed about the facts on October 7th Hamas a terrorist organization Unleashed a brutal attack against Israel killing about 1,00 innocent men women and children and taking more than 200 hostages no one no one in the US Senate no one in Congress denies that Israel has the right to respond to that murderous attack unfortunately however under the leadership of its right-wing prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is under indictment for corruption and whose cabinet includes
(04:15) outright racists Israel Unleashed what amounts to almost total war against the Palestinian people Israel's widespread bombing has left nearly 15,000 people dead that's in a 7 we period 15,000 people dead 2third of whom are women and children and 10 of thousands of others were wounded Israel's military campaign up to this point according to un estimates damaged or destroyed 45 5% of the housing in Gaza 45% and displaced nearly 1.
(05:11) 8 million people the Israeli attacks up to this point have killed 109 United Nations workers and left millions of Gins on the brink of starvation lacking Medical Care electricity or fuel this is a humanitarian catastrophe that risks among other things igniting a wider Regional complication we all want this Hara to end as soon as possible to make progress however we must grapple with the complexity of this situation first Kamas has made it clear before and after after their October 7th attack that its goal is Perpetual Warfare and the
(06:15) destruction of the state of Israel several weeks ago a spokesman for Kamas told the New York Times and I quote I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders and that the Arab world will stand with us and quote let me repeat it this is a Kamas spokesman quote I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders and that the Arab world will stand with us end quote so that's the first point second point is if we go back a little bit in history we understand that
(06:59) Israel has done nothing in recent years to give hope for a peaceful settlement maintaining the blockade of Gaza deepening the daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank and largely ignoring the horrendous living conditions facing Palestinians massive poverty existed in Gaza before October 7th something like 70% of the young people in Gaza were unemployed how is that for a reality in terms of Despair and hopelessness those are the conditions that existed before the Israeli attack needless to say Madame President
(07:51) I do not have all of the answers to this NeverEnding tragedy but for those of us who believe in peace peace and for those of us who believe in Justice it is imperative that we do our best to provide Israelis and Palestinians with a thoughtful response that Maps out a realistic path to addressing the reality we face today and let me just give you a few of my thoughts as to the best way forward and how the United states can rally the world around a moral position that moves us toward peace in the region and justice for an
(08:41) oppressed Palestinian population to start with in my view we must demand an immediate end to Israel's indiscriminate bombing which is causing and has caused an enormous number of Civilian casualties and is in violation of international law the main point here is Israel is at war with Kamas not with the Palestinian People Israel cannot bomb an entire neighborhood just to take out one Kamas Lieutenant that is simply not acceptable and not something the United States should be complet licit with further we must extend the
(09:35) humanitarian paes that exist right now so that the United States United Nations has the time to safely set up the distribution Network needed to prevent thirst starvation and disease to build shelters and to evacuate those who need Critical Care once again we are looking at an unimaginable humanitarian crisis and the UN is going to need as much time as it can get to try to help people in desperate need this window will also allow for talks to free as many hostages as possible and I think we all would like to see every hostage return to
(10:18) their loved ones this extended pause must not precede a resumption of a discriminate bombing Israel will continue to go after Hamas but but it must dramatically change its tactics to minimize civilian harm if longsuffering Palestinians are ever going to have a chance at self-determination and a decent standard of living there must be no long-term Israeli reoccupation and blockade of Gaza if Hamas is going to be removed from power as they must be and Palestinians given the opportunity for a better life and Israeli occupation of
(11:05) Gaza would be absolutely counterproductive and would benefit Kamas imagine Israeli soldiers all over and occupied Gaza for the sake of regional peace and a brighter future for the Palestinian people Gaza must have a chance to be free ofas their can be no long-term Israeli occupation Madam president to achieve the political transformation that Gaza needs and Gaza desperately needs a political transformation new Palestinian leadership will be required as part of a wider political process and for that transformation and
(11:56) peace process to take place is Israel must make political commitments that will allow for Palestinian leadership committed to peace to build support what I think people all over the world want to see and what the people of Gaza want to see is leadership that will take care of their needs provide for them allow them self-determination not leadership in Perpetual Warfare with Israel Israel must also guarantee displaced Palestinians the absolute right to return to their homes as Gaza rebuilt and I am very concerned by some of the remarks we hear
(12:44) from Israel from some Israeli leadership questioning that basic right of people to return to their communities people who have lived in poverty and despair for years as people in Gaza have cannot be made permanently homeless Israel must also commit to end the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and free settlements there as a first step to permanently ending the occupation those steps will show that peace can deliver for the Palestinian people hopefully giving the Palestinian Authority the legitimacy it needs to
(13:27) assume administrative control of Gaza likely after an interim stabilization period under an international Force finally if Palestinians are to have any hope for a decent future there must be a commitment to Broad peace talks to advance a new two-state solution in the wake of this war the United States the International Community and Israel's neighbors must move aggressively toward that two-state goal this would include dramatically increased International support for the Palestinian people including from wealthy Gulf States it would also mean
(14:19) the promise of full recognition of Palestine pending the formation of a new democratically elected government committed to peace with isra let us be clear and I think Madam president this is the main point that I want to make this evening that we should be clear that all of this is not going to happen on its own left alone sad to say Israel is not going to bring this about prime minister netanyahu's leud lud party was explicitly formed on the premise that quote between the Sea and the Jordan River there will only be
(15:06) Israeli sovereignty end quote and the current Coalition agreement reinforces that goal this is not just ideology this idea that Israel has the right to control everything between the Sea and the Jordan River that's just not ideology the Israeli government has systematically pursued this goal the last year saw wrecked Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas that the United Nations and the United States agree our occupied territories they have used State
(15:43) violence to back up this de facto annexation sadly tragically since October 7th the United Nations reports that at least 28 Palestinians including cluding 53 children have been killed by Israeli Security forces and settlers this cannot be allowed to continue Mr Netanyahu has made clear where he stands on these critical issues now is the time for us to make clear where we stand on these issues and the truth is that if ask in nicely worked we wouldn't be in the position we are today asking nicely just is not
(16:39) going to bring about the kinds of changes that are needed the only way these vital and necessary changes will occur is if the United States uses the substantial leverage we have with Israel and we all know what that Leverage is for many years the United States has provided Israel with substantial sums of money with close to No Strings Attached currently we provide $3.
(17:14) 8 billion dollar a year to Israel no strings attached President Biden has asked for 14.3 billion more on top of that sum and ask Congress to wave normal already Limited oversight rules this blank check approach must end the United States must make clear that while we are friends of Israel there are conditions to that friendship and that we cannot be complicit in actions that violate international law and our own sense of decency and that Madame President includes an end to indiscriminate bombing a significant pause to the bombing so that
(18:09) massive humanitarian assistance can come into the region the right of displaced gazans to return to their homes no long-term Israeli occupation of Gaza an end to settle of violence in the West Bank and a freeze on settlement expansion and maybe most most importantly a commitment to Broad peace talks for a two-state solution in the wake of this war Madam president over the years people of goodwi around the world including Israelis and Palestinians have tried to address this conflict in a way that brings Justice for Palestinians and
(18:54) security for Israel Israel is entitled to security to be free of terrorist attacks now I and some other members of Congress have tried over the years to do what we could obviously painfully we did not do enough now we must recommit to this effort the stakes are just too high to give up it is clear that Netanyahu and his extreme right government are not going to do this on their own which is why the United States must use its leverage to force these necessary changes and push hard for a wider political process that leads to a
(19:45) two-state solution these should be the conditions of our solidarity included including in the supplemental spending bill which we will soon be considering Israel is a longtime friend and Ally of the United States and I respect that but when there is this level of Destruction and bloodshed and when tens of billions of dollars have been requested it is more than reasonable for the United States to have a say in where our taxpayer dollars go and how they are spent this is money that comes from the taxpayers of the United
(20:29) States Israel has an absolute right to defend itself but it does not have the right to use American taxpayer funds in violation of international law or with little regard for civilian casualties now I know that when we use the word conditioning people become very alarmed my God terrible idea virtually every dollar that we appropriate has conditions attached to it if you're on food stamps tonight you got condition you're on unemployment you got conditions on Section 8 housing you have conditions we put conditions on
(21:08) everything we don't give away money we say you got to be eligible for it this is what you got to do these are the requirements that's conditioning conditioning in fact has been for a long time seen as the key to US policy regarding foreign governments including Israel not a new idea the United States has routinely conditioned Aid on countries including Ukraine Saudi Arabia and Egypt to name a few president Scot Reagan HW Bush and Clinton all conditioned Aid to Israel to secure changes in their policies President
(21:48) Reagan actually suspended certain arms deliveries and threatened to stop all military aid due to Israel's war in Lebanon that's a condition pretty strong condition sending $4.3 billion to netan Yo's government on top of the 3.8 billion we provide every year and the billions and arms the United States has already provided with no strings attached would be a huge mistake out of step with long-standing us policy and not something I believe that the American people want to see I've laid out what I believe some of
(22:31) these conditions should be and that is an end to the indiscriminate bombing that we have seen a guarantee that displaced Palestinians will have a right to return to their homes no long-term occupation a blockade of Gaza freeze and West Bank settlements there and uh a commitment to Broad peace talks for a two-state solution those are some of the conditions that I think we have more than a right to demand when we provide money to Israel finally Madam president let me end this on a personal note there is no question that people
(23:13) all over this country have strong disagreements on the war and some of the issues that I have been discussing tonight and that is what is part of the democr ratic process and in a democracy like ours it is natural that these issues be debated and people have different points of view but what we cannot do under any circumstances is turned to violence because of our differences not the violence and not the bigotry and I have to say that tragically in my home state of Vermont in the city that I live city of 40,000
(24:03) people Burlington Vermont we have experienced this form of violent hate and just as I'm sure you know a few days ago three young men lovely young men going to college celebrating Thanksgiving in Burlington Vermont was shot and uh one of them is in very serious condition so as we all hope and pray for the recovery of Isham and Kenan and tassin three young men who were shot and we await the findings of the investigation into this terrible act let me say this again loudly and clearly hate has no place in my state of
(24:47) Vermont or any place else in America with islamophobia anti-arab haate and anti-Semitism and racism on on the rise in this country we must must come together and remain Resolute in our commitment to fighting all forms of bigotry and intolerance Madam president I thank you and I yield the FL under the previous order the Senate stands adjourned until 10:00 a.m.
(25:27) tomorrow [Laughter]
