\section{Introduction}

We currently live in an era dominated by technology and information, which will continue to prevail for many years in history. We have reached a point where our reliance on technology and everything associated with it is so profound that we have started to store valuable information on cloud servers. This information ranges from bank account details to confidential government reports.

The internet and servers are intangible spaces that, despite our desires, evoke a sense of mistrust as they are not environments we can fully control. Humans have devised methods to enhance security in these areas, one of which includes the implementation of encryption methods.

\section{What is Encryption?}

Encryption is a security mechanism that encodes data in such a way that only authorized individuals can access and understand the information. In technical terms, it is the process of converting plain, human-readable text into an incomprehensible format.

Encryption is not a novel concept. In fact, in the 1st century BC, Julius Caesar, the renowned Roman politician and military leader, created the simple yet famous encryption method known as the "Caesar Cipher" to securely communicate with his allies while in captivity. This method, for instance, involves shifting each letter of a text a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Therefore, encryption is also necessary to protect important information on the internet, isolating it from unauthorized persons, particularly from those who intend to maliciously exploit such information.

\section{Algorithms of Encryption}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RSA Algorithm:} 
    The RSA (Rivest, Shamir y Adleman) algorithm is a form of asymmetric cryptography that involves generating a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.
    \item \textbf{DSA Algorithm:}
    The DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used primarily for digital signatures and key exchange. It operates by generating two key pairs: a public key for verification and a private key for signing. It is based on the computational difficulty of the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP).
    \\ \\ In this project, for simplification, we will be using always the same encryption keys (equivalently) for both algorithms. Acording to ChatGPT (4.0 version), a key of 2048 bits for both algorithms it maintains a balance between safety and efficiency for experimental settings .  We made a python program to generate RSA and DSA keys which can be found at \href{https://github.com/miguelxsm/Encryption}{this repository}
    \\ The keys generated by the python program, it gives us the necessary key to encrypt and decrypt text fragments.




\end{itemize}

\section {Variables}
In this experiment our interest variable Y (dependent variable) will be the time in seconds needed to encrypt and decrypt a text fragment, the X variable will indicate which algorithm (RSA or DSA) we are using to encrypt the text. Furthermore, we will be using a variable Z that will represent the length of the text (number of characters).

\section{Data colection}
For collecting our data, we will grab different president speeches from United States. We will use a tool to transcript the videos due that it will be collected from Youtube videos. \\
