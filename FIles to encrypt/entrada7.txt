Transcript:
(00:00) we'll take a couple of quick questions and then we'll uh I'll shake a few hands question ma'am go ahead [Applause] hello hi welcome president Trump thank you okay so you kind of already answered my question a little bit but my question was when you become president again what would the first thing you'll do to fix our current school system and even our current military that's only focusing on teaching woke gender ideology over learning the basics of life and history and protecting us so good question uh
(00:34) some of it partially answered but not all uh with the military we're ending woke immediately you know I ended woke totally and then they in their first week they re-established it it's crazy they pay instructors hundreds of thousands of dollars a year it literally I mean literally they want our military to be woke and it's just not going to happen you read in Hawaii where they had the horrible fire where they have people going there and before they bring them on board they have to study woke for a
(01:02) week can you believe this in other words everyone's wanting to get back to their home finding the bodies it was such a tragedy you don't read about it too much anymore but hell is going on over there and they want to give them classes and essentially wokeness can you believe so you know you've seen it well we'll end that very quickly we will uh with the school I think the schools are very important we're going to bring our education department back now if you look at our education we pay more per
(01:27) pupil than any country in the world by three times and yet we're at the bottom of the list we have a bad very bad if a place like Iowa as an example if you could run your own and we give you just a percentage of the money because you wouldn't need nearly the money that they waste in Washington number one you love your students you want your students you know your students the parents will be involved that's the other thing we're going to get the let the parents because some of these school boards have become
(01:53) to radical they've been horrible but we're going to bring that back and that's going to answer your question because I think that we can have one of the best school systems in the world right now we have one of the worst they basically rate 40 countries and we're always at close to the bottom of the list sometimes the bottom of the list and spending more money than anybody else so we're going to take care of all of your needs very quickly and I think it's going to happen very quickly and
(02:20) one of the things we're doing closing the Border day one and starting drilling for oil okay we're going to drill baby drill right okay do you have one over here yes please welcome to Iowa president Trump thank you very much um here's my question I felt that the 2020 election was fraudulent so what measures are being taken by the RNC to make sure that that doesn't happen again okay well you're not the only one because if you look at Paul's many many people big percentage of the country felt it was uh you know
(02:53) they used covid to cheat but they did they would achieve it anyway many precautions many law firms have been hired a lot of work has been done and Beyond RNC I mean uh I wasn't very thrilled with them obviously you know I was always told you go out your campaign I left here early in the morning and you go home and you you know you think you've done great I actually made Seven rallies on the last day or two seven I don't know anybody's going to do seven rallies and they're big rallies and
(03:21) there were full-scale rallies and I left and I said we're going to win and at 10 o'clock in the evening I looked at the numbers and it was over we were doing so well Pennsylvania all these states were doing so well then all of us sudden they made adjustments and all this crap and it was a horrible thing so they were able to do things with covet oh we can't go vote we can't this we can't that Mill in voting we have a lot of great people involved that's more than anything else I say I don't want help in getting the
(03:49) vote I only want help it used to be called election day now it's called election period because some of these things last for like two months right I said that's all I want I want people to work because we went back and we did great and then the vote comes in and then and it was looking great and then all of a sudden this horrible thing happened and by the way it's all down people know it we had judges that didn't want to get involved they were afraid everybody was afraid they were afraid of
(04:16) the subject it's a it's a disgrace what happened to our country is a total disgrace okay disgrace so and look at and look at the results I mean look at the results I mean practically every problem that we talked about today wouldn't have happened Ukraine wouldn't have happened inflation wouldn't have happened I mean so many of these things that we talk about today we wouldn't even be thinking about look at the supply chain whoever heard of a supply chain where people can't deliver
(04:41) you couldn't get baby food you couldn't get anything the only thing you could get is all the drugs you wanted you could get drugs you could get cocaine I wonder whose cocaine that was by the way and the wife what about that deal packages of cocaine and they said well we don't know no no we don't know and then when they went for the fingerprint thing you know everybody's there fingerprints all it was white clean now one fingerprint not one fingerprint which is impossible you can go to any place in this room
(05:15) there's fingerprints all over the place especially those cubicles so uh we're going to be working very hard that's my number one thing much more so than campaigning actually is that they don't cheat on their lap because they will try and they'll be successful to an extent but that we're not going to let them steal this election because this country is going to fail I'll tell you I don't think the people of this country will allow it to happen either because this country is on a very thin Edge right now
(05:44) thank you very much for the question thank you appreciate it [Applause] I want to thank you president for all that you've done and a question I want to ask you is I'm telling you no man can endure what you have endured do you do you realize that God is behind you and strengthening you do you realize that well I appreciate what you're saying I understand what you're saying too it's been a terrible thing in so many ways the only thing the great gratitude I get I'm looking at polls now where we're 50.60 points up
(06:23) you know among all these people and we're beating Biden in all these polls so we're beating everybody and we have had to endure we endured a fake Russia Russia Russia thing for years we endured all of this stuff all fake and think of how bad these people were a guy like Adam Shifty shift is a real bad guy I call him Pencil Neck he's got the smallest neck I've ever seen he's not going to be playing for your local uh teams Iowa Iowa State they're not going to be recruiting him to play football but Adam Schiff he makes up
(06:55) with Hillary and with the Democrats they make up the Russia Russia Russia scam he knows it's a scam think about how bad I have sons and daughters and you know we love our sons and daughters right and I watch him on television one day so he knows it's a hoax Russia Russia Russia turned out to be a total hoax no collusion there was no no anything so he knows it's a hoax right in the middle and he goes out to the microphones after leaving the meeting which is supposed to be very uh you know quiet nobody's supposed to know what
(07:25) goes on in there he goes out to the microphone he goes the president's son Donald Trump Jr will go to prison for what he's done now he knows it's a hoax think of it it's not like I'm reading and seeing and I watch this guy told me I'm watching him saying that my son is going to prison my son is going to prison and I know that he had nothing to do there was nothing there was a whole thing was made up it was a made up so you know why I was made up it was an excuse why Hillary lost they said let's
(07:59) blame Russia and it was supposed to be a one day deal but the fake news wouldn't let it be one day and the fake news carried it and on and on and on we have the same thing right now it's going on still do you know that if I and I got indicted but because the people know me so well they know it's it's all it's all they know that and think of it they say they say he questioned the election he questioned well everybody in this room questioned the election the Democrats question 2016 they were
(08:34) all standing up they were forming cards they were forming all sorts of things they were all and those are the same guys that now that say we'd it's so corrupt Washington's a corrupt place but think of it you're watching some guy on television a high-ranking congressman say that your son is going to prison and he knows that it was a hoax I mean how bad do you have to be to do that and then it gets you know no collusion after two and a half years and then two weeks go by and I had a little peace I focused on China and other
(09:03) things it's almost the easy subject right I focused on the easy things like China Russia and then they start with Ukraine Ukraine Ukraine he made a phone call to Ukraine it was a perfect phone call you know that phone call turned out to be absolutely nobody's ever seen anything everything I said was right about please study if there's any corruption please report it to the Attorney General of the United States it's a it turned out to be exactly right A lot of people are saying right now they've got to undo even the theory of
(09:36) those in debt because those indictments were fake just like everything else so we have to get back to making our country great again but you're right many people ask me that question they say how do you how do you do it and I do it because I feel real love and I feel real appreciation and I do it because it's more important than anything else I could do I could be living a very nice life a very nice life in the most beautiful places all over the world and here I am with you in Iowa and I'd rather be here I'd rather be here
(10:08) so thank you very much very much appreciate it [Applause] thank you hello Mr President my question for you is what are you going to do to make future Generations more successful than what we are right now well we have to save our country first I really do I mean it's a great question in a way but I think our country we have 30 almost 36 trillion in debt uh we are probably if if this group keeps running think of what's happened we used to be allies with Saudi Arabia a lot of money a lot of everything a lot
(10:43) of energy we didn't need their energy that was the beauty but we were allies with all these different countries everyone's left us Brazil is up with China now Saudi Arabia is with China many of the Middle Eastern countries a lot of oil a lot of money there was China we've lost the whole of South America is with China this all happened over the last two and a half years it's unbelievable we have no relation with all the money we waste on trying to bribe friendship you know we try and bribe our friendships we're not with
(11:15) anybody we don't have anybody and Europe honestly takes advantage of us on trade and on NATO they take total advantage of us and you know you see that with Ukraine we're trying to help them and the problem is Biden got so far ahead of this thing that now you know they're saying well why should we have to put up money the stupid Americans are putting it all up you know that's what happened Europe is we're 200 billion and they're 25 billion and it's right at their store step and we we have an ocean in between
(11:44) us it's much different so the first thing just to answer your question we have to save our country okay said it's a sad answer but it happens to be true okay how about we do one more we always have to end on a good one okay we have to end on a very good one hi president Trump um first of all I just want to say that I love and respect you so much and I want to thank you for being America's biggest fighter so um there's that but I also let's have a policy related question I just want to know if you have
(12:15) any words of advice or encouragement for a lot of us young conservatives who are afraid to speak out as you may know um I definitely know from being a student at Iowa Hawkeye State by the way and I just want to know you know especially with the caucus coming up we need to get a lot more young people out there so I'd just like to know if you have any thoughts on how we could be better Patriots to get you sure it's so great that you asked that and with such enthusiasm and everything Etc so remember this
(12:46) there are far more of you than you think you don't see them you don't see them I know people in Beverly Hills I see them on television we will stop Trump but they go in a vote for me you know no it's true it's like you think it's woke it's not you look at the percentage of votes and everything else if you can count on them which you basically can't but look you just keep your thoughts and keep because you happen to be doing the right thing there are many many more of you than you understand there are many
(13:15) more of you than there are of them and a lot of them are you because it's common sense you know they say are you a conservative are you whether you're conservative I'm conservative but I'm really a person of Common Sense we need a wall we want low taxes we want good education we want to be able to build and buy houses you know nobody can buy houses anymore because the interest rates are so high remember when they were high I was jaw boning that guy get them down you better get them down they
(13:43) said you can't fire the head of the Federal Reserve but he thought he was going to be fired and you know you take a look at interest rates what's happening right now you just stay just the way you are you shouldn't change it all and just go out there and people respect you and they respect you more than you would ever think and there's so many of you okay and you're going to a great school thank you all very much so remember that get out and caucus and have a good time thank you everybody
