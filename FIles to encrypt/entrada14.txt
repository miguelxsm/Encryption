Transcript:
(00:03) let me uh thank all of you for being here let me thank those who couldn't get into the room or outside uh let me thank Neil Levesque and the saint anselens Institute of politics uh for hosting uh this event Neil has done this for so many years and he does a great job and I appreciate all that he does it has always been my view that good policy is good politics if you deliver for the American people if you address their needs they will respond accordingly it has also been my view that being honest with the American
(00:53) people even when speaking the truth is uncomfortable and painful is not only the right and responsible thing to do but it is also good politics and that's what I hope to do this afternoon the American people the American people are tired of press releases they are tired of follow-ups they're tired of tweets and they're tired of Snappy one-liners they want an honest analysis of what is going on in our society now and they want leadership which provides answers to the many crises that we face they want to understand
(01:49) why we are where we are today and how we can move to a better place make no mistake about it today all across our country or or deep feelings of anger tiny ears discontent and foreboding God is true for those who Define themselves as Progressive as I do or those who see themselves as conservative or moderate it is true for Democrats Republicans and independents it's true whether you live here in New England California the Midwest the South or the Rocky Mountains in a world which is changing rapidly in so many respects
(02:54) many of our people are anxious they feel left behind and they are uncertain about the kind what the future will be for them and their kids perhaps most importantly they feel powerless to alter the course of events and believe their elected officials are not only found them but have little understanding of the pain that they are experiencing men are even questioning whether our current form of government is capable of addressing their needs or responding effectively to the crises we face it is no secret that I want Joe Biden to be re-elected
(03:56) president [Applause] and that he and I share the goal of beating back right-wing extremism while also more Democrats to have majority control over the Senate and the house and governors mansions and state houses all across this country that is what we want in my view in my view however if that is going to happen if we are going to defeat creeping authoritarianism and right-wing extremism that has got to be an ideological change of course Democrats up and down the line are going to have to be much clearer to the American people as to what they
(04:51) stand for and most importantly which side they are on in the foreign [Applause] I am more than aware that most Democrats are prepared to take on a reactionary Republican Party which wants more tax breaks for billionaires what's cuts to Social Security cuts to Medicare cuts the Medicaid cuts to education and nutrition programs and is a party which largely ignores the existential threat of climate change almost every Democrat I know stands with the women of this country [Applause]
(05:59) and Democrats are united in their opposition to racism and [Applause] response if Democrats are serious about winning elections and addressing the major crises that we Face they must go further they must erase the working class of this country in a way which hasn't been done in almost 60 years frankly it is absolutely absurd that given the anti-workout ideology and policies of the Republican Party that that party now has more working-class support than Democrats
(07:04) it should be deeply worrying that according to recent polls Democrats are losing more and more support within the Latino community and even among African-American men that has got to change not just for the well-being of the democratic party but for the future of our country Democrats once and for all must reject the corporate wing of the party and Empower those who are prepared to create a Grassroots multiracial multi-generational working-class party in every state [Applause] Democrats through words and action
(08:04) must make it clear that they stand with a struggling Working Class A disappearing middle class and millions of low-income Americans who today are barely surviving let's make it clear that they are prepared to boldly take on the powerful corporate interests who have so much power and influence in Washington at its state capital for philosophers they will protect the needs of young people who everything being equal might well end up with a lower standard of living than their parents and they must make it clear
(08:58) that they will vigorously fight for the seniors of our country and they're disabled who so often face difficult and expensive Health Care decisions most importantly Democrats must reject austerity economics and understand that with the new and Innovative Technologies being developed we now have the capability as never before in world history to provide a decent standard of living for every man woman and child in this country in fact we now have the opportunity of creating an incredibly bright future Democrats must make clear that these new
(09:58) technologies and the artificial intelligence now being created must work to benefit all of our people and not just the corporations that are that technology in my view if Democrats are prepared to do that they will win this election and Win It comfortably if not frankly I am not sure what the election outcome will be or for that matter what the future of our country holds now if we're going to be honest with the American people we have got to acknowledge the realities of today with the understanding that many of
(10:47) these crises have existed for decades and within that context let me say a few words about some of the achievements of the Biden Administration in in first three years and I know something about it because I have been there working with President Biden and those of us work with them have every right to be proud of what we have accomplished especially especially given the fact that that work was done in a very divided and contentious Congress frankly we didn't got a lot of help from Republicans yes we should take pride in the American
(11:33) Rescue plan which is one of the lowest moments in modern American history remember back a few years ago when we were dealing with the worst Public Health crisis in a hundred years and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression we all remember the fears and the pain that existed well as a result of that legislation we help Revive Our economy far faster than anyone could have imagined we should be proud of that [Applause] finally making significant investments in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure
(12:22) remember years and years everybody talked well guess what we did it we're starting to rebuild our roads our bridges our Wastewater plants broadband and creating hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs in the process thank you yes we should take pride in the unprecedented Investments we have made in renewable energy and energy efficiency yes why we have a very long way to go we should take pride in that we have finally begun to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry [Applause] the trade agreement
(13:12) agreement fact that our manufacturing base we should take pride in the fact that we are now in the process of rebuilding Manufacturing in the United States creating a lot of good jobs as we do that yes yeah we should take pride in the fact that unemployment today is extremely low here in New Hampshire it is all of 1.
(13:47) 7 percent inflation so long ago stood at nine percent has been reduced three percent [Applause] more than any president in history has created an Administration that actually looks like America in its diversity that is so small yes we should take pride in what we've accomplished but at the same time this 2024 campaign at the presidential level and on down must be honest with the American people and acknowledge the very real challenges that persist for Working Families low-income Americans and the middle class while we take pride in our
(14:53) accomplishments we must also recognize the reality that tens of millions of our fellow Americans continue to live in pain and despair and interestingly this is exactly what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt you'll remember Franklin Roosevelt exactly what President Roosevelt whose portrait now hangs in President Biden's Oval Office it's what Roosevelt managed to do when he ran for a second term in 1936.
(15:33) empty off perhaps the most popular and effective president in American history remember that's the guy who won four terms govern during the extremely difficult periods of the Great Depression and World War II on January 20th 1937. Roosevelt gave extraordinary speech and his second in in which he took the opportunity not only to focus on his accomplishments but rather on the unfinished business that he was determined to complete this is what he said I want you all to appreciate this now this is a guy was completed his first time he's now in
(16:21) his second term this is what he said he said in this nation I see tens of millions of its citizens a substantial part of its whole population who at this very minute are denied the great apart of what the very lowest standards of today hold the necessities of life he was President four years and this is what he spoke about he says I see millions of families trying to live on income so Megan that the Paul of family disaster hangs over them day by day sound familiar I see Millions whose daily lives in city and on all
(17:05) pin you on the conditions labeled indecent by a so-called polite Society half a century ago and he continues and this is kind of famous lines he said I see Millions denied education Recreation the opportunity to better their life and the lot of their children I see Millions lacking the means to buy the products the bomb and Factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many others and this line You'll all remove remember he was President for four years this is 27. I see one-third of the nation ill
(17:48) house ill-clad ill-nourished and he concluded by saying it is not in despair that I paint you that picture I painted for you in Hope because the nation seeing and understanding the Injustice in proposes to paint it out we are determined to make every American citizen the subject of his country's interests and concern and we will never regard any faithful or body group within our borders as a purpose the tests of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for
(18:40) those who have too little [Applause] by Roosevelt is extraordinary for its Candor and honesty in describing the gravity of the problems confronting America in his life and even though he was the sitting president he was prepared to talk about that in other words despite the progress he had made in his first turn he understood that much much more had to be done of course he was not really and this is an important point he was not really informing people about conditions in America instead he was reflecting back what
(19:42) people already knew what they felt in their hearts and what they experienced in their day-to-day lives he was reflecting their reality in that way his remarks were not an indictment of his own Administration but instead a rallying cry for working-class families across the country to come together with him in a joint effort to cure those ills in my view we need to do now what Roosevelt did then we need to be clear to working people that we understand the reality of their lives and our political discourse must reflect
(20:37) that reality and what is the reality if we're going to be honest and here it is in the wealthiest country in the history of the world which is what we all know tens of millions of our people struggled to put food on the table find affordable housing Affordable Health Care affordable prescription drugs affordable child care and affordable educational opportunities that is an indisputable reality and it is imperative that we acknowledge that reality that we do not run away from it time of unprecedented income and wealth
(21:26) inequality while the billionaire class and the one percent are doing better than at any time in the history of the United States over 60 percent of our people live paycheck to paycheck and many are working for starvation wages and under terrible working conditions there are people in America where they don't have any vacation time they're scheduling is awful sometimes despite massive increases in worker productivity and an explosion in technology the average American worker is making 45 dollars a week less today than he or she
(22:13) did 50 years ago you know why people are angry and that is adjusting of course for inflation and when I was a kid growing up a few years ago working class families and I Come From A working class family one person in those days was able to earn enough money to pay the bills very few families that you know do not now have two red Breadwinners often working really crazy hours today in America we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth unbelievable fewer than half of working age Americans
(22:59) have any retirement savings people 50 60 years old have been working their whole lives they got nothing in the bank as they face retirement and that number of course is even higher for women today despite spending twice as much per capita on health care as almost any other country 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured one out of four patients cannot afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe as a result of a massive shortage of doctors nurses Mental Health Providers and dentists many millions of
(23:44) Americans wait months in order to get a medical appointment tens of thousands die every year because they cannot afford the health care they need when they the tens of thousands die while three people one two three on more wealth than the bottom half of American society nearly 600 000 Americans are homeless and some 18 million house spend over half of their income to put a roof over their heads while major Wall Street firms gobble up working class neighborhoods in order to gentrify them and make huge profits workers are unable to find
(24:32) a housing that they can afford there was once a time not so many years ago United States led the world in terms of the qualities of our Educational Systems we had the highest percentage of people who were college graduates and a very high quality public school system today in an extremely competitive global economy that is no longer the case and we now lag behind many other countries in our educational achievements in many states teaches or pay embarrassingly low salaries meanwhile over 45 million Americans are drowning
(25:19) in over 2 trillion dollars in student debt for the crime the crime of getting a higher education today in America not only do we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had we have more concentration of ownership in sector after sector of our economy whether it is finance agriculture energy defense Contracting media Transportation health care or big Tech a small number of large multinational corporations control what is produced distributed and sold the idea that our economy today the rhetoric that we hear is based on small
(26:09) business and rugged free enterprise and competition is nothing more than a myth but the crises we face today on not just economic and I think everybody knows that in communities throughout the country there is an increase in crime we are struggling with a major opioid epidemic I know New Hampshire and Vermont have been in awed by that and we are now experiencing the worst Mental Health crisis in modern history exacerbated by the covet pandemic our life expectancy how long we live here which is already lower than most
(26:50) other major countries is getting even lower in many parts of the country because of widespread addictions to alcohol and drugs increased obesity and a growing suicide rate racism sexism and homophobia continue to plague the country as we see an increase in hate crimes with the school year now beginning earns and kids worry about the epidemic of gun violence and they are asking themselves couldn't happen in our school further the American people know that our political and constitutional systems are in trouble
(27:38) we have a former president who refused to acknowledge his defeat and encourage a violent insurrection Phil could turn the election results we have state legislations all across this country working overtime to make it harder for people of color and young people to vote and who are gerrymandering districts in order to stay in power and last but not least we have a campaign Finance system which is totally corrupt which enable billionaires through their super Pacs by elections the American people also know that we
(28:30) have a Supreme Court that has for the last 24 years May fall-reaching decisions that upon the Mind faith not only in the Judiciary but the ability of our government to respond to the needs of the people the people and that is not only their absurd and anti-democratic decision in citizens united but their willingness to undermine Decades of precedent and deny the women of this country the constitutional right to control their own bodies [Applause] his faith in our democratic system is now extremely low many millions of Americans have not only
(29:23) lost faith in the Democratic party and the Republican party but they have lost faith in democracy and then on top of all of that if that's not enough and just when you think the challenges we Face could not be greater the United States and the rest of the world face the existential threat of climate change what a summer it has been we have breathed the unhealthy smoke coming from the terrible forest fires in Quebec we have seen the floods in my state in Vermont the worst natural disaster in my state since 1927.
(30:11) we have observed the horrific death toll in Hawaii from the horrible flash fights we have observed the drought floods fires and record-breaking heat waves in Asia Africa Europe and Latin America increasingly our people understand that climate change is not only real but that the planet is well on its way to becoming less healthy and habitable for our kids and future Generations given their fears millions of young couples throughout the world are literally wondering whether it even makes sense for them to have kids
(30:54) so where do we go from here now it's easy to define the problems it's a lot harder to suffer how do we write Revitalize American democracy and how do we move forward toward a government which to quote President Lincoln is of the people by the people and for the people in a divided nation how in fact do we bring our people together to address the economic social and environmental crises we face and create a government that works for all and not just of you in my view by articulating the reality of Americans
(31:43) lives we will begin to recreate the trust that has evaporated in the institutions of government and the major political place to be credible we have to name names and demand accountability it just cannot be every political leader in every corporation and every institution other than Donald Trump and a few Republicans is acting in good faith the truth is that we are where we are today because the people on top the people with the power are extraordinarily greedy dishonest arrogant irresponsible and could care less about the needs
(32:46) [Applause] let us confront reality it's not as Republicans tell us the fault of immigrants or racial minorities or women or LGBT people or Muslims or any other minority group or the very desperate situation that too many people find themselves in that's what Republicans do and that's what demagogues always do they pick a group and they blame them for everything the reason so many have it so bad is that never before in the history of the United States have so few had it so good owned so much and had so much economic empowerment
(33:45) never before in the history of the United States have so few through their super Pacs campaign contributions lobbyists and ownership of the media had so much political power and never before in our history has it been more necessary for all of us standing together to rest that incredible power away from the few and redistributed to the men whether it is Wall Street we have three investment Pros three exercise incredible economic power as they control over 20 trillion dollars in Investments got it three firms control
(34:38) 20 trillion dollars in Investments and combined the major stockholders in the vast majority of SNP companies whether it is the health insurance companies who make huge profits offer dysfunctional Health Care system that cost us twice as much per capita as virtually any other country on Earth whether it is the pharmaceutical industry it makes tens of billions of profit every year while charging us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs whether it is the major defense contractors who produce massive cost
(35:19) overruns and have jacked up our military spending to some 900 billion a year whether it is the food industry which has dramatically increased prices at the grocery store while reaping enormous profits whether it is Big Tech which intentionally addicts our kids to social media platforms and contributes to the Mental Health crisis facing so many young people perhaps most important it is the fossil fuel industry which has line and line and line for decades about the quotation of climate change and their insult to injury is now
(36:10) enjoying record-breaking profits as they raise the price of gas at the pump and it all together had it all together and what we are seeing is an unprecedented level of corporate greed in fact over half of the inflationary costs that we have seen in the United States in recent years have nothing to do with the war in Ukraine nothing to do with broken supply change but everything to do with the greed of corporate America the prices they have raised and the record-breaking properties by the way this is not just an American
(37:00) issue this is a global issue while over 6 million people throughout the world died in the terrible covet pandemic and millions more became ill because they were forced to go to work to support their families a billionaire class used the pandemic to make themselves even richer during the first two years of the pandemic listen to this remember people are dying all of them work is going to work getting sick dying during the first two years of the pandemic the world's 10 richest men more than doubled their portions from a mere
(37:39) 700 billion to 1.5 trillion meanwhile 99 of humanity saw their incomes go down and an additional 160 million people throughout the world were forced into power these multi-billionaires want it all and they are prepared to step on anybody who gets in their way they are not nice guys now how no matter how much they contribute to the local Art Museum or their local Charter they are not nice to people this is the kind of corporate greed we're looking at now and the kind of greed that virtually all Americans whether they are black or
(38:34) white or Latino Asian American or Native American this is the kind of greed that the American people are increasingly disgusted with and this is where good policy is good politics if we are looking at bringing the American people together we have got to have the courage to take on corporate grief thank God we should take another lesson from President Roosevelt as he was fighting against the cabal of the economic Elite of his era in a 1936 campaign speech in Madison Square Garden during the Democratic Convention this is what Roosevelt said
(39:29) quote we he's talking about his first four years in office we had to struggle with the old enemies of Peace business and financial Monopoly speculation Reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism wall profiteeria they had begun the elite had begun to consider the government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own hotels boy does that sound familiar to me you see the login we now know we've continued that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized model and he can do
(40:18) it just as never before in all of our history have these forces been so United against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and I welcome their hatred [Applause] because there's so many lessons to be learned he continued quote I should light the habits that of my first Administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match I should like to have it said of my second Administration that in it these forces met their master and quote [Applause]
(41:20) said in the 1936 campaign which by the way he won in a landslide and that is what we should be saying in the 2024 campaign [Applause] to welcome the hatred of the billionaire class that is doing so much harm to our country [Applause] get along we must address the crisis of wealth and income inequality and demand that billionaires and large profitable corporations start paying their fair share of houses whether they like it or not we must increase the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of 7.25 an
(42:26) hour to a living wage of at least 17 dollars [Applause] we need to end the concentration of ownership in this country and break out giant monopolies that are strangling small businesses and keeping inflation artificially High [Applause] who wants to join a union has the opportunity to do so and no longer tolerate the illegal anti-union activities of Starbucks Amazon and other major corporations they like it or not we need to establish once and for all that Health Care is a human right doctor [Applause]
(43:35) we must take on the greed of the insurance companies that made over 69 billion in profits last year while tens of millions of Americans die because they're unable to get the medical care they need the current health care system is broken it is dysfunctional we need to fight for Medicare [Applause] and if they like it or not we need to take on the grief of the truck companies who have over 1800 paid lobbyists in Washington you got that 1800.
(44:17) so that we no longer continue to pay by far the highest prices in the world for medicine whether they like it or not we must take on the military industrial complex cut military presence in expanding Social Security benefits affordable housing child care and education [Applause] it will save the planet by Transforming Our Energy System away from fossil fuels to renewable energies and Energy Efficiency [Applause] we will overturn Citizens United against billionaires cannot be allowed to continue to buy elections
(45:21) now let me in the United States and in fact throughout the whole world of here is actually going on in many for the establishment faith in the establishment and their institutions is in Decline people want change they're not happy with the status quo and change will come the question is what kind of change will it be will it be the kind of change that is dominated by the wealthy and Powerful a change which bans books denies our history hits one group of Americans against another and treats women as second-class
(46:16) Citizens not smart enough to make important decisions for themselves that is one kind of change they could very well happen but there is another kind of change which could happen and that is a change that would create a fairer more just and more Democratic Society based on love solidarity and compassion [Music] change motivated by the principles of economic social and racial Justice the choice is and I know the kind of change I will be fighting for thank you all all right all right
