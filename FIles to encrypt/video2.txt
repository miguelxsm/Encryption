Transcript:
(00:00) [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you very much and I'm thrilled to be in this beautiful place boy are they are they messing up California but we're thrilled to be here with the conservative Patriots who are leading the charge to take back this state from the radical left lunatics the first step to saving California begins super Tuesday you know super Tuesday March 5th 2024 the same day that the radical left Democrats are taking me to trial I wonder how that
(00:58) happened I don't think it's going going to happen either disgraceful what they're doing with your support in this election we're going to win the California Primary in a very big beautiful historic landscap and you know most candidates would get but then we're going to win California well I'll tell you what I'll say it a little bit differently because we would win California in a general election if they didn't have a rigged voting system where they send out 22 million ballots at that all mail in ballots 22
(01:32) million ballots people getting five ballots six ballots nobody knows where they're going who they're going to who signs them who delivers them and who the hell counts them nobody knows we would win you should see the crowds of people outside you wouldn't believe it it makes you look like small timers okay now if anybody would like to give up your seat for some of the people outside we will do that would anybody raise your hand other than that that it's a very well-run election system other than those little things it's a
(02:05) disaster it's a Rigg system and it's a shame that it's been allowed to go on for so long it's really sad every time I come here we have the biggest crowds and then I'm told automatically that if you're a republican running for president you'll lose by 5 to 10 points we don't lose by 5 to 10 maybe some others would but we're not going to lose by five we're going to win we would win I don't believe it when they say it but the state is rigged it's a rigged election it's a horrible thing and we
(02:36) have to turn it back this is a state that the right Republican can win and I think actually win easily and all you have to do is you look at go outside and look at what's going on in the streets outside and it's with love too tremendous love there's not a lot of people there's no people that are negative actually no way we lose this state in a real election if this was a real election there's no way if we had a real election with the real polling boost if you had real polling you don't
(03:07) have any polling boost you have people signing something dropping it in a mail then who the hell knows what happens after that it's ridiculous but if we had polling Booth same day voting voter ID and no mail-in ballots other than for those who are legitimately very sick or in Far Away military we would win this state by a lot and I don't know why more people aren't bringing that up and talking about it because it's really something you have to do but we're going to get it done when we win when we win
(03:40) the big one because we're leading by a lot we're going to go over some polls if You' like to don't forget we're going over polls I only talk about polls when I'm doing well remember that please but when we win we're going to come in here and you're going to straighten out your election because we need fair and free elections in this country country and California doesn't have it we have open borders we have rigged elections it's not a bad that's not a bad thing for the enemy to watch that I
(04:12) can tell you and they talk about it all the time I'll solve the BHA problems within 24 hours of taking office we at the safest borders in the history of our country just three years ago but the rigged election has to be solved by you the people and we're going to start working on it right now but I want to put those thoughts in your head we have to bring it back we have to get rid of this mailin ballot stuff you know Jimmy Carter I know a lot of you think that he wasn't a great president but actually compared to Biden he was one of
(04:47) the greatest presidents the happiest person on Earth right now is Jimmy Carter because he said darling I'm no longer a bad president because compared to this guy when I'm president that will be a primary focus your election and other things that we're going to talk about together having to do with California nonetheless we're going to crush crooked Joe Biden next November we're going to make California great again and we're going to make America great again we are going to make it great I want to begin by thanking

(08:02) of the America West American culture and America's future and our Great American Dream you don't hear about the American dream anymore do you you used to hear the American dream the American dream there's no American dream with Biden most corrupt president in our history the Golden State gave us the Gold Rush the Golden Gate Bridge and the Golden Age of Hollywood what glamour what beautiful glamour if they ever came back from the dead that they say what the hell happened to our state can you imagine that was a glamorous time now
(08:34) they would look and they would say this can't be happening it built Liberty ships the Sunset Strip Disneyland and the internet and the iPhone so many things came out of California it was California that first elected public office Republican presidents how about that Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan both both but while California was once a symbol of American success today under the radical left fascists and marxists that run your state that's who's running your state bad people it's becoming a symbol
(09:14) of our nation's decline Gavin Nome and the far-left Communists in Sacramento he did a great job as mayor of San Francisco didn't he but the farle Communists in Sacramento San Francisco and La cities which are absolutely being destroyed rapidly on a daily basis have given you Sanctuary cities wide open borders Mass homeless encampments out of control taxes soaring income inequality like nobody's ever seen before Marxist District Attorneys woke Tech tyrants they are woke rolling blackouts child sexual mutilation and roving bands of
(10:01) looters criminals and thugs but other than that I think they're doing quite a good job those things are all true what a mess how the hell do people vote for these people you the courageous Patriots of California Republican party are now the last line of defense standing between this state and total Anarchy and I am here to tell you that help is on its way help is on its way can't go on like this can't go on like this we can't go on like this we won't have a country left the mission to help
(10:42) you liberate California from communist rule begins at noon on inauguration day 2025 2025 we got to be I'll tell you the election of 24 is the single most important election in the the history of our country I used to say at about 16 it's the most important and it was but this is more important because we're going to lose our country our country is going to hell our country is being destroyed together we will take on the ultra left-wing Liars losers creeps perverts and freaks who are devouring the future of this state like a swarm of
(11:23) locust and we'll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi who ruined San Francisco how's her husband doing by the way anybody know and she's against building a wall at our border even though she has a wall around her house which obviously didn't do a very good job but then you have kamla Harris she's great Gavin Nome who is a really I mean I watched him the other night with Shan Hannity trying to say that California is wonderful it's not wonderful we all know it it was wonderful it could be wonderful again
(12:10) but right now it's really a mess Maxine W is very nice woman very very how come she can say things so violently you will go in and attack them in a restaurant you'll do this that nothing happens if I say peacefully and patriotically oh there's an Insurrection going on on here Maxine Waters if I ever spoke like her it would be the electric chair times 15 for me the man who fell in love with the Chinese spy that they wouldn't take off their top committee most important committee Eric swalwell what a
(12:56) loser and then you have of course my favorite Shifty Adam shift Pencil Neck he's known for one thing the world's smallest neck you ever see I call him pencil if you touched him his neck would break and we will defeat their corrupt California political machine no shifty shiff is really I mean he is a sick person that guy looks like he won't be your next Senator anymore because he'll have somebody else put in then he won't be able to run Purgatory Ah that's too bad I don't know that he would have won
(13:36) anyway but now he probably won't be able to run and he won't run against certain people because he wants to be politically correct except when it comes to doing numbers on Republicans and keeping it going and hurting our country but uh it would look to me like he won't be there but he's a disaster that guy they're all dis crazy Nancy is a total disaster she's nuts remember her with a beauty paror walking through the beauty paror nobody else is to have their hair done then you have her I I don't know
(14:03) what happened to the owner of the beauty you know she is a big Maga person how about that think Nancy think Nancy was thrilled when she learned that the owner of that beauty parlor where they taped her walking through with the hair and the whole thing everyone else is like home using Suds on the hair like I do but I'm the only candidate who will do what it takes to get this job done and remember we have to get rid of mailin ballots we have to do it and I was going to tell you though before we got off on a tangent that we
(14:43) talked about Jimmy in a different way but Jimmy actually had a commission which was very important at the time and his one basic finding his most important was don't use mailin ballots they can't work they will be corrupt you'll have corrupted election and lots of other things but basically was a mail-in ballot statement after many months of him and some of the other senior Democrats they literally came to a conclusion you can't use mailin ballots so what do we do we're always trying to expand them you know in France they use
(15:14) mailin ballots and they found they were so corrupt that they gave them up and they recently had an election 36 million people 36 million voted by 10:00 in the evening yet a winner yet a loser and it was over and nobody complain they went to all paper with little ID you ever see what it is to get into the Democrat convention they had the Democrat N I call it the Democrat you know they like to call it the Democratic because it sounds better I hate you know for a speech it sounds lousy to say Democrat but that's what it is it's called the
(15:51) Democrat National Committee I don't know why they don't change the name but they always say don't ever say that because it doesn't read well but I say Democrat because it does sound bad frankly but you did you ever see what you have to wear to get into their National Convention prior to the presidential election for the primaries and all you have to wear a thing the largest sign I've ever seen it looks like you're trying to sell groceries in a shop that's two blocks it's like here it's
(16:21) got your picture it's got your finger prints it's got everything they probably put Social Security numbers on they put everything on but for voting you can't have anything there's only one reason they don't want voter ID because they want to cheat that's the only reason no V you have ID on every credit card you have it on everything but think and you know the interesting the people of the Democrat Party it's 87% think that you should have voter ID it's only the leaders because their policies are so
(16:55) bad that they couldn't get elected I mean who want who's going to get elected with open borders a woke military High interest rates high taxes a country that's not respected anywhere in the world we've totally lost our place in the world pretty soon we're going to lose our dollar as currency it's a worse thing that'll be worse than losing any War they are so bad and now I'm hearing the northern border is a problem how about that one the northern border they're but it's actually becoming less
(17:24) because the southern border is so bad they can say you know with me they were trying because they couldn't get into we had the safest Border in history the safest Border in history 3 years ago all this guy had to do is go to the beach now he's going to the beach all the time now he's got a consultant I don't know har me of you know his consultant he's got a consultant who thinks he looks good in a bathing suit I guess and he's at the beach every day if he would have done that instead of
(17:54) destroying all of the things we did we had the greatest stay in Mexico a little thing called remain in Mexico we had the greatest Catch and Release we used to catch and release release them in our country our Catch and Release was you catch them release them in Mexico and Mexico was fine with it because if they weren't we were going to put tariffs on their cards like you wouldn't believe and they said we'd love to have you do whatever you want to do sir together we will reverse the decline of America and we will end the
(18:26) desecration of your once great state California this is not a great State anymore this is a Dumping Ground you're a Dumping Ground the world is being dumped into California prisoners terrorists mental patients you have mental institutions they say sir please don't use the words insane asylum because that s you know that Silence of the Lamb stuff that's big stuff mental institution sir is nicer I said no I think I'll mention both we mental institutions and then times 10 insan they're all being dropped they're all
(19:00) being dropped into our country we're a Dumping Ground when I was President I got along with Gavin Newsome but I didn't like what he was doing very simple I liked him you know he always goes around telling we had a very good relationship we had a good relationship but I didn't like what he was doing the people of California don't have water they pay a fortune for the water you know I own something in palis veres anybody play my big beautiful Club on the ocean I actually I think is the best golf course in California but beautiful
(19:31) with the clubhouse everything right on the ocean and this is really on the ocean I always say I have the ocean Pebble Beach has the bay there a big difference true they talking about Pebble Beach Pebble Beach no no I have the ocean they have the bay you know the ocean tends to be better historically oceans are better than Bays do we agree right but I have to pay a fortune for water to water the grass I have to pay a fortune if I told you the number I don't even want to tell you the number it's embarrassing and you have so much water
(20:04) and we're going to talk about that but during that period of time I got to know California quite a well you know I've owned that for a long time and it's become a tremendous success but the taxes that you have to pay and all of the things you have to pay it's a very very hard way to make a buck in in uh the state very hard to do it at one point I was riding up a highway with a number of great congressmen like Deon Nunes at the time you know he's heading up truth social he left he would have been the top guy in
(20:36) Congress he want to do that he's doing a phenomenal job is everybody on truth please better than any of them truth and he's the he's now the president and doing an unbelievable job you know he's the one that figured out Russia Russia Russia I said anybody that can figure out Russia Russia Russia can head up truth social do you agree and he and Jim Jordan they got the presidential medal of freedom because they did such a great job but but at one point with Devon and some of his friends Congressman great
(21:07) one still there we were riding up a highway and were fighting so hard they were fighting so hard for water rights they actually said could you come we don't have any water I said no I didn't know you had a drought it's a man-made drought you know that man/ women so men women made I don't know I don't think women did that no women are too smart to do that they don't create droughts no it's a man-made drought let's leave it man-made I think women will be honored when I say that but
(21:38) during the trip up the highway I noticed massive amounts of Farmland it was all over the place and miles and miles it was absolutely dry and dead you could see you know I'm a real estate guy I could see the soil was so beautiful but it was just dry and absolutely dead except does everyone know what I'm talking about except for little tiny patches where it was so beautiful so green it was greener than any Farm I've seen it was just beautiful and I asked what's going on here why is it that that
(22:06) land is so fertile but right next to it for miles and miles it's just empty looks like a desert and they said because we're in a man-made drought that's what they called it we have a man-made drought I said what's a man-made drought he said we have tremendous amounts of money and other things coming at us to fight this but it's it doesn't do any good because Nome and any Democrat Governor they won't allow us to have water you know you have massive amounts of water coming down from up North so I said all right I can
(22:40) understand about the water but I don't understand why would they do that why are these patches so magnificently green and it's a very small percentage of the land they go well they allow us to water only these small areas but most of the Farmland they don't let us even touch they won't let us touch it if I could do it it would be billions of billions if they if they changed this and we worked on it and I'll explain that it would be billions and billions of extra dollars coming into the state and coming into
(23:11) our country and we have the water and I said what about a desalinization plant well people don't like them because you know I said what about a nice big beautiful D but they said we don't really need it sir we have so much water we wouldn't know what to do with it I said explain please you know I'm looking at this dry stuff I said explain so much water but up north they have a valve do you ever see the valve a massive valve like your kitchen valve but multiply it times 10,000 it's the size of this room and
(23:46) all the water gets turned out and turned into the Pacific Ocean do you know that you have so much water so sad to see this I mean these people are it's so stupid but they don't want the water to come down all the way to Los Angeles and the Central Valley where we're constantly forced to ration you have droughts we're rich people in Beverly Hills we don't feel so sorry for them but I do actually you know they pay millions of dollars in taxes they're taking a shower they're told to hurry up
(24:16) you're only allowed a small amount of water when they take a show that's why rich people from Beverly Hills generally speaking don't smell so good you know typically you ever notice they're not great their hygiene is not good but it's forced to be that way so when you meet somebody with a beautiful house in Beverly Hills you know that person is sort of disgusting under there but where you wash your hands and you're supposed to take no more than 30 seconds they want a quick quick hands and yet they're paying millions
(24:51) and millions of dollars in taxes millions of dollars these people and and whether it's rich people or people people that are just paying a small amount of time you're allowed to have water and you can have it for free for free you know we have all those canals they dry as a bone so now in Los Angeles when you have a new home you have faucets washing machines dishwashers all of the things but very little water is allowed to come out like as an example I stayed in one of those houses and they had a shower head and I want to really
(25:22) work hard on my hair and I don't want to take and I turn on the water I thought the pipes were broken they said no they call it a restrictor they have restrictors in the thing so no water comes out so I'm standing onside drip drip can't wash the damn hair the house $35 million house and you can't get it you can't take a shower honestly it's a bad way of life I mean it really is it it it sort of hurts and everybody this goes for everybody this is all because Gavin doome and the radical left Democrats extremists and
(26:03) the people that run the state in order to save an extremely unimportant very little and nonproductive fish the Delta smelt did you ever hear of it little do they have a picture of it there it is that little sucker is causing you to not be able to clean [Applause] yourself the Delta smelt because of that Delta smelt you don't have any water you don't have Farms you don't have anything you're all going bust and you know they were talking last year they're going to have to uh put massive amounts of restrictions on your
(26:38) water years it's it's ridiculous and then you pay a fortune for it to you have so much water you have no idea millions and millions of gallons is sent out it's just turned out you got to see this thing big massive pipe massive and they turn it takes a day it goes bom at the end of the day it's turned into the Pacific Ocean in fact we should get har meat to bring a lawsuit on that one that's a good lawsuit har meat that's a good one Army that's big stuff she wants to do it she'll do it
(27:11) free CU she lives in this area right she wants but when I was President all of the work was completed in the federal government to make the big change in the quality of life for California you could to have so much water you wouldn't know what the hell to do with it and you had the water and the papers were done I got it done at the Commerce Department believe it or not it was mostly a Commerce nobody ever thought that could be done and that was the hard part the state part was easy all you have to do is get a governor to
(27:40) sign but we did all the work we went to him Gavin Nome and he wouldn't sign it because he wanted to keep the environmental lunatics happy these are lunatics and we had it out you wouldn't believe but I'll tell you what then we had coid come in we had a lot of things happening and we uh we did an incredible job look we had the greatest economy in history the greatest economy in history twice we had it twice but I had the federal government finish everything all the paper was done you were going to have so much water you
(28:12) were going to say please please Mr President don't give us any more we're drowning in this water you stand coming from Canada coming from up North when the snow melts and we didn't know what the hell was going on and you look at those you know we have all the infrastructure done these big bins where you the water comes rushing down they are also dry as hell now they have weeds growing in them and so it's all there and the federal work was the hard part and I got it done but Gavin didn't want
(28:39) to do it one of the first things I'm going to do when I get back into office for California is forced n to give you water and by the way the smelt is doing very badly on top of everything else I think it would do better if it had water okay to be honest so much water that uh you know I mean it's like just incredible but the smelt is not doing well but we're going to get the federal government that to get everything done we have it almost completed it was totally completed and I guarantee he will sign it very quickly
(29:15) if he's still the governor by that time who the hell knows you had a recall how did that work out how did that work out well one of the candidates running was doing well and then they said do you think the election was rigged and stolen no I don't that was the end of his campaign that was the end they walked out that was a not a good thing to say not a smart thing to say and it wasn't truthful I mean the act the election was a disaster but you'll have so much water and it'll be a great thing and some of
(29:48) the most fertile I will tell you for the farmers in the room I don't know if you know it or not but I got $28 billion for the farmers some of the far people are farmers here from China who the hell else is going to get money from China who would ask for money I said to the secretary of agriculture Sunny Purdue I said Sunny because China took very big advantage of us during Obama during the Obama years and really bad and at the beginning of mine I said what's going on over here people would complain and I figured it out said how
(30:18) much damage have they caused the farmers over the last three four years they said so about $28 billion I say all right good we're going to put a big tariff on WE tariff we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China nobody knows this we put in tariffs on their cars coming and everything in fact the 27.
(30:38) 5% Tariff on the cars they haven't gotten rid of it because so much money it's so big that they cannot justify getting rid of it it's unbelievable you wouldn't have any car plants if I didn't have that China would have been sending their cars at levels that nobody's ever seen before but they paid us billions and billions I took at 28 billion took in 28 billion gave it to the farmers that's why I was told by my great professional Susie Wilds I was told by my great professionals over there that they said sir please don't say that it
(31:08) sounds too uh obnoxious I said I don't mind being obnoxious because I'd say I'd say I'd say very strongly I'd say there's no way I knew I could lose Iowa Nebraska Wisconsin any of the states you have a lot of farmers here there's no way I can lose no Farmers ever voting I gave him $28 billion from China nobody else would have asked for that could you imagine you go up to Biden he's a corrupt person you go up to Biden you say you know uh I want you to ask China to pay 28 billion to our Farmers you
(31:45) know what he'd say I can't do that they paid me a fortune I'm got to get myself in trouble they paid him a fortune you think he can go up and ask him they'll say we're going to expose you you know he's a Manchurian Candidate that's what he is all the currently dry canals will be brimming and used to irrigate everything including your own homes and bathrooms and everything you're going to be happy and I'm going to get it done fast they say that there's so much water up north
(32:14) that I want to have the Overflow areas go into your forests and dampen your Forest because if you dampen your Forest you're not going to have these far forest fires that are burning at levels that nobody's ever seen before we have very poor Land Management and remember when I said that a couple of years ago as president I said man we're we're sending billions of dollars to California for forest fires their forests are burning down and I was with a a gentleman a very top person in Austria he said sir we have more
(32:45) flammable trees than you do on your Coast we don't have Forest fles we have Land Management they take care of the land they pick up the dead trees you know a tree doesn't burn very easily unless it's dead then it gets dry and it burns the leaves on the ground they're five feet thick over here they clean the the floor and everybody said oh how ridiculous management of a forest you know they all said like what the hell but they don't have forest fires and properly run locations what we have is
(33:17) is horrible and we can actually dampen our forest with water that costs us nothing that will come pouring down from the north wouldn't that be nice if you had dampened floor you wouldn't have forest fires so we'll we'll work on that too but I couldn't convince this guy Gavin to do it because he's a environmental Maniac only for political reasons you know he's no dummy he knows it's wrong he knows what they're doing is wrong I watched him the other night being interviewed by the great Johan
(33:46) Hannity and I said you know he understands it but he's playing a game because that's the base I guess and but it's you know people say to me are you conservative yes you're conservative sir I said I'm conser conservative but really what I am is a person of Common Sense we need borders we need elections we need water we need water for places like California for your Farmers I mean those Farms would make a fortune you know it's among the best land in the world and nobody knows it nobody nobody can do anything about it
(34:18) because of the water so we're going to get it all done and if they don't do it it's very simple we're just going to say that's okay you take care of your own forest fires and all the other things sort of happening billions and billions of dollars and they'll sign whatever they want we had coid come in and that sort of changed our little direction for a little while we had to do something there we did a great job with that you know interestingly when we uh had the co we took a big hit every country in the
(34:44) world did and by the time I gave it over to these lunatics by the time we gave it over the most incredible thing our stock market was higher than it was just prior to co coming in nobody can even believe it so it was higher than it was and what they're doing is they're really running on the fumes of trump they're doing a terrible job inflation all that and if you really look at the the numbers with the inflation how that's destroying you know inflation is called a country killer you can look at countries over
(35:13) the last 200 years big inflation like we have and have had but but like we have I don't know if you looked at your gasoline today $6 $6 oh they said higher I know I heard $8 I didn't want to say it cuz I can't believe it but you have uh yeah $8 gasoline in some parts of your area and all over the country gasoline's going way up don't forget they they kept it artificially Low by taking the oil out of and the gas out of the Strategic oil reserves that's meant for Wars that's meant for M that's not meant to keep
(35:51) people's gasoline down so they can win an election that's meant for very serious purposes I got it filled up up now it's at the lowest point it's ever been at they drained it and that was artificial but that only lasts for a fairly short period of time so now new records are being set like gasoline Gavin has become crooked Joe Biden's top surrogate I think because he doesn't think Biden is going to make it that's why he's doing it he doesn't think he's going to make it and it won't be him so
(36:23) easy he's going to have a big fight however because there will be a lot of Democrats uh competing is going to be very interesting but let's see look some people say Biden's going to make it does anybody think he's going to make it to the Starting [Applause] Gate I mean the guy can't find his way off of a stage look here's a stage here's the stage I've never seen this stupid stage before right I've never seen it but if I walk left there's a stair and if I walk right there's a
(36:54) stair and this guy gets up up where am I where the hell am I where am I nah he's terrible terrible you know I'm much tougher in him than I used to be out of respect for the office I was never like he's the most corrupt president the most incompetent president we've ever had but when they indicted me and then again and again and again I was never indicted now I'm setting records Al Capone was not indicted so much alons Capone if you looked at Al Capone in the wrong way he'd kill you he was not
(37:44) indicted like me I was never indicted I didn't know when they taught me at the Wharton School of Finance they didn't talk about indictment it's no it's a disgrace what's happening theyve weaponized elections they've done everything I mean the these are very bad people but I used to talk relatively nicely about them I wouldn't go out of my way I wouldn't say the things I say now now I'm just all in because these people are bad and they're dangerous and we have to stop them I
(38:11) wouldn't say what I say now I never did i' joke I'd have a little fun with it but I wouldn't call him I call him the worst president in history I call him the most corrupt president in history and I call him the most incompetent president other than that he's doing a fabulous job I think ladies and gentlemen doing a fabulous job along with Quicky Joe Biden Newsome is also killing our car industry your cars are ridiculous what's happening and crushing our great automakers in Michigan Wisconsin Georgia North Carolina and
(38:43) South Carolina crushing them under his leadership this is Nome California has imposed the most ridiculous car regulations anywhere in the world with mandates to move to all electric cars the problem with an electric car number one you lose all your jobs because they're all going to be made in China and other countries they're not going to be made here at all I was up in the other day in Michigan like the other night we had an incredible crowd and they were the United Auto Workers Auto Workers and and others but we were sort
(39:13) of focused on the Auto Workers I said you got to endur Trump because I'm going to save your industry we're going to have a thriving car industry this lunatic is going to destroy he's going to go all electric think about all electric and I have no problem with electric you should be able to buy an electric car you should buy a gas a fired car you should buy a hybrid you should buy whatever the hell you want I mean some people like electric if you want to drive for 14 minutes to the candy store it electric is very good but
(39:48) if you actually want to get into a car and drive for a few hours you know they're doing a couple of other ones with electric they're going electric crazy uh it doesn't work uh they want all electric army tanks now think of this army tank so they want to have an army tank that's electric you can't get it recharged it doesn't go far enough it doesn't go strong enough but they want to have electric so that we will go in with environmentally nice no do you believe it no can you believe it then they want
(40:38) to have then they want to have our jet fighters our jet fighters that our best way go they can make a turn on the size of a dime bomb bomb they want to use fuel that's a little bit better for the environment so that as we're attacking in some country trying to devastate some country because they've been bad to us we go in we're dropping bombs all over the place but at least we're not leaving any environmental footprint these people are crazy and the problem is you know I stopped it because
(41:15) they came to see me sir we have a new fighter jet we think it's environmentally friendly I said who cares if it's a you're dropping bombs all over the place you're shooting everybody no it's true he's shooting everybody no we think it's environmental I said what's the bad side well there is one problem it's about 15% less effective that's a lot you know what 15% is for a fighter jet the difference between being shot down and shooting the other guy down that's a difference
(41:52) that's a big difference and then another Beauty just while I'm on it you don't mind if I go off script do you they like it I have the greatest guys Rosses back there and Vince they greatest guys but you know every once in a while you got to go off script you just can't you got to do but the how about this one the trucking industry supply chain we got enough problems you never heard about supply chain during the Trump administrations after we left they want trucks now to go all electric and they
(42:30) give them a very short period of time so all these big beautiful companies they have these massive Peterbilt Trailways they have these big beautiful trucks they cost a fortune they have a tank of diesel that goes 2,000 miles think of that up to 2,000 that's pretty much Max but 2,000 miles an electric truck doesn't have the right torque or a pull we'll have to ask somebody in other words it's it's not as good but it goes 300 mil so they have to stop approximately 6 and 1 half times every time and by the way it takes
(43:07) a long time to juice them up and I don't even talk about the fact that you know you don't have charges because if it was good you could build them right but you know they're building charges all over the place it's a disaster you know they say you know the greatest part about having an O electric truck the first 10 minutes after it's charge up you're so happy but after 10 minutes now you're in a state of trauma cuz you're wondering where the hell am I going to get a charge to C very traumatic it's a very traumatic
(43:37) experience so you have a truck that goes 2,000 miles on those beautiful things they got the bedrooms in there good enough for Trump to live I'd live in one of those trucks you ever see those big beautiful rooms they make them like sweets now these trucks are incredible they're unbelievable actually they're incredible machines one of the top guys in the industry said they'll all go Bank bankrupt the supply chain will die and you know I I shouldn't even say this I should let it happen because it's good
(44:02) for the election but I don't want our country to be hurt they won't do anything though you know like open borders You' think they close the borders they're not doing it you would think they would be closing the borders right now that have they they don't care they actually want I think they want to destroy our country but but with the trucks you would think that they'd sit down for about 3 minutes with trucking companies and after 3 minutes say sorry we can't do that I was with great boers
(44:29) they make a great South Carolina the other day great great company they make boats now they're starting on they want an all electric boat they don't want to use the Mercury and the different you know the gasoline powered engines they want all electric so I said to the head of the company companies like 50 years old doing great make hundreds and hundreds of boats but now they're not selling well because the interest rates are too high they're not selling the whole thing they said sir I mean I'm
(44:58) like the an angel to them I walk in because they had the best four years of their life and he said now it's all ending but now they want to force him to go two things 2 miles an hour you know what that is a slow golf cart goes 10 mil an hour up to 90 miles up to 90 MI 2 mil an hour I said how far does the boat go 60 mil so in other words beyond what the boat goes they want them to go just very slowly and they want to do the new regulations are coming out all electric boats I said to the men and this is a pro you if I
(45:34) could sit down with him in five minutes and know exactly what you have to do I said would it work no sir because the entire boat would have to become a battery it the batteries take massive amounts and it would be so heavy that it would sink and then I asked him a question he said you must have a science background I've never been asked if you're in a boat and you're sitting on top of a bat battery and the boat starts to sink do you get electrocuted let's say the boat is going down and you have a choice you got a
(46:07) shark that's 10 you got a shark that's 10 yards away or you can go down with the damn boat and get electrocuted honestly you know what I take I'm taking the boat every single time I want the boat but this is where we are they want army tanks these people are crazy but the trucking industry is probably worse than the Auto industry I have a friend that bought a car and he thought it was environmentally good by the way it's environmentally bad because the batteries are a disaster you can't get rid of them all those things but I
(46:40) have a friend he bought a car because he want he's a conservative guy but he wanted to be you know he believed all this nonsense that they're putting out and he bought a car and he always makes a trip from Kentucky politician he makes a trip for Kentucky to Washington DC quite a bit and he'd usually make it and you know get out of the car and he'd probably have gasoline left over no big deal now he goes and he's stopping all the time stop stop the guy was a nervous wreck like he got down there about 4 days later the
(47:14) guy was a disaster I said are you okay I said How's your environmental experience working but you know electric car's fine if you're going to go short distances you're going to go you know within a very short period of time and uh very short distance but we have to make everything available hybrids are good oil gasoline is good don't forget we have more gasoline than any country in the world and we're sitting on top of it and you see where the UAW is on strike we were up with them as I told you and
(47:51) they're on strike and they have a leader who hates Trump he hates Trump I said listen here's to I have an idea for the leader hates Trump because I'm a republican because they don't know all they can do is see Democrat the Democrats are going to destroy you're not going to have any Auto Workers left and it's going to be in two years and I told them you're negotiating these wonderful hourly wages but it doesn't matter because in two years you're not going to have any jobs left they lose
(48:16) $60,000 on every car they make all electric 60,000 so these companies are you know for the most part going to go bankrupt but what's going to happen is they're going to close them up and have the cars made in China where they can buy them much cheaper you're not going to have any jobs left so tell your union that if you're smart they should endorse me immediately and you're going to have a thriving you're going to have a thriving life and I believe the UAW workers will be on my side 95% I really do they
(48:46) they're all screaming we love Trump you had to see the crowd we love Trump but their Union boss is a big Democrat he likes Biden what's to like I said what's to like he has no idea who the you are and if you ask him tomorrow did you meet with the Union yesterday he's going to say I have no idea this guy but you know what his radical left marxists that surround him in the office they know who they are you see they know who they are because he's not running the country the people that are running the country are the people
(49:18) that are in the White House and they're vicious they're vicious and they're destroying our country under a Trump Administration gasoline fired engines will be allowed but child sexual mutilation will be banned is that okay you okay with that and we will prosecute those involved in California's depraved new laws that strip parents of parental rights can you believe can you believe who would have thought that 10 years ago if somebody got up and said we will stop child sexual mutilation people would say this guy crazy who would we
(50:12) have to stop it it's it's going on at a level nobody without parental rights or who would say that we will give parental rights over your children back to parents who would think that you would have to say or that men in women's sports will not be allowed who would think can you imagine this you know Brian eracer the big football player great football player from is a massive guy big strong guy he was a great uh Hall of Famer and everything played for Chicago and I was with him a couple of months ago and we
(50:47) were standing at my golf club in Palace ver Trump National and he said uh we're talking about things and I looked at the size of this man right he's retired now but had a Hall of Fame career top top-of-the-line guy great great player but big and my manager came over Lily she's fantastic but she's very small she's the size of his leg maybe and I took a picture of Lily and Brian ER locker and I said we will not allow men in women's watch and you see and you saw the other day they had a
(51:21) weightlifting deal going on and there's one young woman she was so proud her parents were in the front row she was going to break the record they put a quarter of an ounce on each side of the thing stood for 18 years and she got up and she I don't want to imitate it because you know my wife the first lady hates when I do this she said it's not presidential I said yeah but people like it true she hates me our great first lady she'll say I Lov your speech today cuz it's all over the place look at the fake news back
(51:54) there we get a lot of ratings you know we outdid the debates in the ratings did you I made my speech to the UAW and we got better ratings than they did but but no she said it's not presidential and I understand she has one two things that and she doesn't like when I dance a little bit to the music I that's not and I say I have a problem everybody wants it they're screaming dance dance but our great first lady and she doesn't like when I talk about the swimmer either but maybe I'll do it
(52:29) because this is a little bit you know this is a special group so they get these are Republicans that have been screwed for years in California you deserve a little entertainment right you deserve so so they put the weights on the end little tiny things like a little nothing quart of an ounce and she gets up and her parents are so proud H 19 years she's almost Bo couldn't do it then this guy who recently transitioned he gets over the weights looks at him they said have you lifted before no I really haven't she was a world champion right I
(53:22) haven't lifted too much a little bit I did it recreationally oh good so he gets over the same weights he broke the record like by 180 lbs and then they say we will have men in women's sports these people are crazy you know I'm not a big fan of LeBron James but I said this I said this I would like to meet with LeBron say LeBron I've decided I'm going to get out of the presidential business get out of the real estate business say I'm going to become a basketball coach of women and I'm going to get him and four
(54:01) or five other guys to transition and we are going to have the greatest basketball team in history we will be undefeated forever we will make the legendary John Wooden into just a little Aster now it's it's is crazy the swimmer remember Championship swimmer she wanted to break the record she was going to do it she looks left and these are people they've been you know athletes they' been sort of at a top level they're sort of competing with the same guys one of the PGA Tour guys said yeah I played
(54:39) with him when he was six I played with him when he was 10 12 you know there just a certain Elite group of people and uh played with him all my life and now they're on the senior tour they're still playing against each other same thing with other sports and she looks left and she sees all of these uh young ladies that she's been swimming against for years she looks right and she sees it but then she looks over here and there's this huge guy with a wings I say with a wingspan somewhat larger than
(55:08) Wilt the still Chamberlain do you know Wilt the biggest wingspan anybody's ever seen 7 foot2 but she sees this guy say oh wow and I tell the story it's a very sad story she was seriously injured you heard about this right you know what happened to her she got injured with wind burn because this guy went by her so fast that the wind gave her horrible horrible Burns they took her to the hospital but she'll make it she'll be okay so much for the record he finished the r then he went to lunch and as the other girl swam in he
(55:46) was going to lunch he said let me go to lunch while I'm waiting for them to come in now how ridicul and you know what it's very demeaning to women it really is it's ridiculous very Dom meing the state of California has no right to take children away from their parents and sterilize them they take a Moy sterilizer them can you believe this I will stop it immediately all of that crazy stuff will be stopped I will protect your you I will protect parents and their rights and we will have them make decisions for their children they
(56:18) are going to be making the decision I will protect our country and we will restore Public Safety to our Community under the radical left Democrats your once beautiful cities have been overtaken by millions and millions of illegal aliens psychotic drug addicts bedum squalor nobody's ever seen anything like it nearly half of the stores in downtown San Francisco have shut down and the rest are going to be shutting down targets Walgreens all of them they're closing up because your Das they're marxists and they only go after
(56:58) Republicans but your Marxist Das and they given hoodlums the green light to pillage and plunder your stores to do whatever they want and swanky Beverly Hills arm Bandits stalk their victims home to Rob them at gunpoint in their garage or their living room they wait till the garage opens and then they go in and they rob the hell out of them and they take the trunk of their car and they break it open people leave the doors and Trunks of their luxury car s in Beverly Hills they leave them hanging wide open so that people don't destroy
(57:31) their car trying to break through and smash through the windows and the doors while rumaging through to steal the tires and other valuables they leave their trunks open because if they don't they take a crowbar and they get it open so they say look if you want to take my tire it's okay can you believe that we've and this is happening a lot can you believe that this is where our country has come under the Trump Administration we will bring back Law and Order to California to stop the far-left prosecutors who are deliberately
(58:19) destroying our civilization and our culture I will direct a completely overhauled d J to investigate every radical da and AG in America for their illegal racist and reverse enforcement of the LA and we will start with the Marxist monsters unleashing Mayhem on Los Angeles and San Francisco in places where there is a true breakdown and don't forget when we were in office we had a period of time short period of time where they were attacking in Washington nobody likes to talk about this and they were trying to
(58:57) rip down our statues and I saw what was happening it was really weird it was they wanted to rip down statues of Abraham Lincoln George Washington they didn't really care they just wanted to destroy our culture and I very quickly took an old law that I saw and I reinstituted it and it basically said that if you rip down anybody even attempting to rip down a statue of anybody in Washington DC gets 10 years in jail you don't get 10 years but you're off N9 and a half for good behavior you get 10 years in jail
(59:29) there's no anything and amazingly everything stopped everything stopped but in places where there is a true breakdown in the rule of law such as Oakland oh Oakland is so bad I will use every Power at my disposal but it's not Oakland it's in Los Angeles it's all over I mean it's terrible it's in places that you wouldn't even believe but I will use every everything I can every single power at my disposal including sending as many federal law enforcement assets as required to restore safe
(1:00:06) safety and peace and we will immediately stop and some people going to say oh this is terrible I can't believe you know these people are killing people when they go into the source you'll have 300 young people who are not looking for a good future walk into a store big department and just pillage it and if you happen to be there when they're there they'll knock the hell out of you and kill you in some cases and we will immediately stop all of the pillaging and theft very simply if you rob a store you can fully
(1:00:39) expect to be shot as you are leaving that store shot and everything will immediately stop you won't have any more of that and you know our law enforcement is great but they're not allowed to do anything they're told to stand by stand back don't touch don't touch they watch hundreds of kids walk out with television set and if they do anything they lose their family they lose their house they lose their pension they get fired we have the greatest law enforcement in the world they know exactly what to do but they're
(1:01:36) not allowed to do it by incompetent politicians the word that they shoot you will get out within minutes and our nation in one day will be an entirely different place there must be retribution for theft and destruction and the ruination of our country this is a phenomena all over the world people are watching this this doesn't happen anywhere else but we've taken away law enforcement we've taken away their dignity we have the greatest people one of the most important things maybe the most important thing being a
(1:02:19) police officer being somebody that's protecting us and they're not allowed to do their job and they want to do their job border patrol Brandon Jud all these guys Tom homman a great a great border person these people know exactly what to do they know exactly what to do and they'll do it but with the uh inner cities or just the cities it's no longer inner cities this is happening in areas that nobody believes these kids walk out with television and not kids some are men and a lot of it's organized now
(1:02:52) where they actually go and take everything out of the store and then you see this guy selling stuff 5 miles away or selling it from behind cars it's a horrible thing when the police are allowed to do their job and that means in some cases shoot them this will stop immediately immediately our police are amazing and it puts our police at Great it puts our police in great danger but retribution on our Pol I mean look take a look retribution on our politicians and political opponents who are leading in campaigns by Lots oh we are beating
(1:03:33) them badly that's what they really that has to stop what they've done is they've gone after opponents so that if you become president or some other job but if you become president and you don't like somebody or if somebody's beating you by 10 15 or 20 points like we're doing then I have to call up har me Dylan can you believe it right harit did you ever see anything like what's going on I got indicted four times I said a record it's a record most indictments in the shortest period of time who is it
(1:04:25) Trump trump what the hell did he do more than half of the unsheltered homeless people in America live in communist run California think of that as president I will use all available powers to take the homeless drug addicted and severely deranged and get them off your street so that law-abiding citizens can once again enjoy the parks and public spaces for which they're paying a lot of money in taxes with all of the money we will save by ending Mass illegal immigration if you look at it we will have a gigantic
(1:04:59) Surplus a gigantic Surplus to get our homeless population the treatment they so clearly need now many of the people will never be they'll never be made better these are people that in many cases are in such bad shape they'll never be made better seriously addicted and lots of other things happen when that happens but we also you know don't forget we're taking in the world's population we're taking in the mental patients from all over the world you have mental institutions that are empty right now in South America and
(1:05:31) many other places all over Africa where they're bringing these people to the United States having them walk into our country and we're living with them some of these people are very dangerous it's also you're taking uh prisoners many prisoners if you look at the prison population in South America and all over the world including Africa Europe I mean all over the world the prison populations almost some cases doesn't even exist they've taken all of it and they're dumping well like a Dumping
(1:05:59) Ground they've dumped it into the United States these are the idiots that are running our country so it makes a really bad situation much worse but we're going to have the largest deportation operation in the history of our country you can't do this nobody can sustain this nobody we will rapidly rebuild the most secure Border in the United States just as we had 3 years ago 3 years ago we had the strongest Border in the history of the United States I built almost 500 miles of wall I watched this loser
(1:06:33) Christy Chris chrisy he built 50 BS no no you know what they say if there's a 2x4 lifting laying in the and it's rotted rusted but it was there for 50 years but it's not they call that a renovation so therefore they don't give me credit we take the 2x4 we throw it away we build a beautiful exactly what you know the wall we built is exactly what border patrol wanted we actually had mountain climbers we had P you wouldn't believe how talented these people are they could scoot up that with 100 pounds of drugs on their back it's
(1:07:02) amazing the panels on top they're deim they're called deim panels they make it very hard to climb over everything is done for a reason and they're steel they wanted them to be steel with concrete inside and then rebar hardened concrete and rebar we did everything just as we should we built almost 500 miles we had another 200 miles that we would have built we already achieved our objective and I had to deal with guys like Mitch McConnell and Paul rhyo do you know Paul rhyo Paul Ryan we had a deal with Paul
(1:07:33) Ryan Mitch McConnell all these guys and uh it was brutal so what I did is I said the hell with it this is an invasion of our country I'm taking the money out of the military and we did military was great it's an invasion but we built almost 500 miles then I said you know let's build some more because it what happened is you'd have other areas that you wouldn't see then and all of a sudden they were open become open it became paths and we were ready to do that it was all ordered and the election was rigged and then
(1:08:02) these guys come in and they took that stuff and they actually brought it away and now they're trying to sell it for two cents in the dollar can you even believe it it was all ready to be installed and that's when I first believe that they actually want to have open borders and nobody can explain it they don't need the votes because they cheat you know they cheat so well they don't need the votes so you know everyone says oh they're doing it for the votes no they don't do it for the votes because they cheat so much that uh
(1:08:24) it's a lot easier I'll also use title 42 to end the child trafficking crisis by returning all traffic children to their families in their home countries immediately and estimated 22% of students in LA Public Schools are from a household headed by an illegal alien can you believe it in your community not only is this deeply unfair to American children whose classroom resources are being crucially drained and just horrible really it's a cruel thing that's happening they're being depleted but it's turned many of your schools
(1:09:03) into war zones and dangerous gang members from MS13 your children are going to school with gang members from MS13 tell your children not to get into any fights with them if you don't mind okay I want your children to be aare these are tough these are tough people tough kids but you know who's tougher ice but ice doesn't get the credit ice what they have to go through they go a lot of gang members MS13 gang members are in Long Island for some reason they just that's where they go they love Long Island and they killed
(1:09:33) not so long ago two beautiful 16-year-old girls walking to school and they sliced them up with a knife because a gun is too fast and they made them suffer greatly both dead both killed and ice will go in and they will they call them packs packs not like a political pack slightly slightly tougher and they will go in and they will go into that pack and they'll start swinging swinging swinging I have a few friends here they're pretty tough guys a couple of them they won't do this work I will tell you but I says that they're incredible
(1:10:03) Patriots they don't get any credit we took them out by the thousands and thousands we took MS13 out of our country thousands and thousand and when I first got into office I was told very strongly very strongly that you cannot bring them back to their country El Salvador Honduras Guatemala and others that they put planes on the runway so our planes couldn't land they blocked up all the bus routes and they said Obama gave up because for years he tried but he couldn't get them back so they wouldn't
(1:10:33) even bother they just let them stay in our country and kill people and I said really how much money do we pay those three principal countries they said sir we pay them $750 million a year for economic development you know who the economic development is for the head of the country that's what it's for they live very very nicely in nice beauti beautiful chatau so we give them 750 I said tell them effective immediately they're not getting any money the following morning early in the morning I get a call from all three s not
(1:11:05) simultaneously like separate like one 2 8:00 one two three the three president sir we understand there's some difficulty are you having a problem yeah you're not taking your people that you're sending us you know they send them to us they don't send the good they send the ones that they don't want like MS13 which is the tough gang in the world and typically speaking when somebody comes and they have tattoos all over their face I'm not discriminating at all but typically it's not a positive
(1:11:35) thing okay and I said you're sending us your people and you're sending us gang members and killers and murderers and people from jail and we're bringing them back you won't take them you won't even let our planes land Sirah we would like to uh apologize for that we didn't they're only doing it for about seven years right we will be glad to take that back sir when is our money starting again sir and uh so I made a deal and I still haven't given him the money you know it's I just held it back what the damage
(1:12:05) they've done is so bad but now Biden wants to give him $4 billion I read the other day four billion for what you know what it does it makes them stronger in the sense of not economic development but they steal more and the gang members get more it's so corrupt this whole thing is so corrupt what we do is so crazy is so crazy but we brought the MS-13 gang members and Killers out by the thousands and thousands and brought them back into their countries I will invoke the alien enemies act which is very powerful to revie to remove I mean
(1:12:37) we're going to remove all known suspected gang members drug dealers and cartel members from the United States of America ending the scourge of illegal alien gang violence forever we're going to get him the hell out of our country we don't want them in our country this is just the start of what we will do to save California and you got to remember our story is on water it's no wonder the far left lunatics are getting desperate to stop our Movement by any means necessary okay so we have magga now if you ask Biden
(1:13:11) you know did you see him the other night he's saying we must stop radical magga you know what magga is make America great again right we must stop make America great again you know it's you have to be sort of what a stupid thing to say but but think of it this is the greatest movement in the history of our country do you know do you know that politicians for years if they ran in New Hampshire or Iowa if they ran in South Carolina Early States any state and if they came in like second third fourth they would have
(1:13:48) a great career as a political pundit they would be celebrated all Pat Buchanan was a great guy actually but he came in you know did well in New Hampshire just did well didn't win it but did well and for many many years he was a very respected voice on television on shows many people like that we won 42 States think of this we didn't come in 2 third fifth nth we won 42 States and then we won 50 states and then we had an election that was incredible and we won in 2016 and then we had a much better election much much
(1:14:25) better we did much better in 2020 we got millions more votes but we had a rigged election I was St by the best pollsters fabrio was great Tony Fabrizio mlet great those two they told me sir if you got 63 million votes you can't be beaten we got almost 75 million votes that they report that's what they report because it's much higher than that the most any sitting president has ever gotten and at 3:00 in the morning they said oh at 10:00 we had it made at 3:00 we just found lots of ballots Slots of B that's
(1:15:03) all they know how to do is cheat on elections and frankly they have to do that because their policies are no good their policies are no good open borders high taxes as you know crooked Joe Biden and his radical left thugs have weaponized law enforcement to arrest their really leading opponent it happens to be me do you mind if I mentioned that on fake and phony charges they're fake charges she knows better than anybody they are this high level election interference and it's happening this is what it is it's called election
(1:15:37) interference try and destroy a man so that he can't get elected and don't worry about the indictment or the subpoenas because after the election nobody cares if I weren't running I'd right now be I could be very happy but I like this better because we're making our country great we're helping people much more important but it's all happening for a single reason because I'm the only candidate that they don't want to run against you know they're people of great misinformation or disinformation very
(1:16:12) similar meanings I go both misinformation disinformation very close they always say the opposite so they say we want to run against Trump we want to run if I'm leading they want to run against Trump they don't want to run against me I mean these polls are so incredible that are coming out they don't want to run they want to run against anybody but me they'll take the sanctimonious in about two seconds but they say we want to run against Trump and last week's big ABC Washington Post poll I'm leading by 10
(1:16:44) points against Biden and in another one I'm leading by 12 and another one I'm leading by seven they're not they're not happy they're not happy and and look how could they be happy how who would vote for this person who would vote for this person our country is being destroyed and you know I don't know maybe people feel sorry for him that's the only way he can win is if you feel sorry but don't feel sorry for him because he's not a nice person and he never was a nice person and he goes
(1:17:20) after political opponents and things in a way that nobody ever has done other than in banana republics or third world countries that's what they do that's exactly what they do and in the brand new thank you in the brand new New York post pole just came out an hour ago I'm beating Biden by 11 points when asked who you think will win and just uh a few minutes before I came up on stage the morning conso poll that's a very big one that's a very respected poll I'm a at 63% and Ron Des sanctimonious is at
(1:17:58) 12% and the others are way lower and in New Hampshire the sanct demonius is now falling into fifth place oh have I done a number in that guy have we done a number on him guy had no chance of getting elected governor he came to see me little tears in his eyes he came to see me sir I could I need your help what's what do you need my help for I didn't even know him that well but he was one of about 100 congressmen that would talk about impeachment hooks number one and impeachment hooks number two on television so I saw him a little bit I
(1:18:30) need your help sir not winning in Florida he was losing by like 30 points or more Los he was getting killed he it was over for him with the primary taking place in a short period of time and I said Ron if I were George Washington and Abraham link combined and I came back from the dead and I endorsed you I don't think it would matter you're gone man he said sir you're very popular in Florida you know I got 1.
(1:18:56) 2 million more votes than him you keep hearing how many votes I got 1.2 million votes than him and I'm the one that turned Florida red not him he didn't turn Florida they all go on my fumes but I said if you do that then I said look you know I didn't know the secretary of agriculture his name is Adam putam nice guy but he was leading by numbers that were like not as much as I'm leading these guys by but he was leading by big numbers it was over they were already measuring the carpet in the uh in the state house they were going to
(1:19:33) be they were going to have the most beautiful carpet you've ever seen in the Mansion as they call it but I said all right Ron let's do it and I did it and this guy went up like a rocket ship I've never seen anything like it he was dead in other words without me he was dead and then they asked him and then I helped him get through the general election by the way he was running against a very very hot guy he turned out to be a crackhead but these are minor problems but he was the hottest him and Stacy Abrams were the two
(1:20:01) hottest female male politicians in the country Democrats and he said I won't be able to beat him I gave him three giant Trump rallies I said you're going to win run I don't think so sir anyone okay then four years later they said will you run against the president he said I have no comment I said no comment that means that guy's running that means he's running and I said started hitting him very early harit said don't please sir he's a republican don't hit him he's a republican sir I said I don't give a
(1:20:32) damn if he's a republican got ahead of he's a republican hary he's a republican I don't care what the hell he is and I hit him hard and he's crashing Like a Bird that's seriously wounded in [Applause] flight and here in California we're leading by a gigantic margin with Trump at 48 and DeSantis who's now at a number that's so low they don't even know what I think they've given up on them but we're we're leading by close to 50 points 0 and for NFL fans any do you have any
(1:21:14) NFL football fans here we will not play prevent defense you know what prevent defenses you hold them scoreless for almost four quarters then you just have to do once more and they go to prevent and prevent right all the football fans are nodding there's only about 2% of you in this room prevent is something that's supposed to work but it doesn't it means you get soft we don't get solved we're also doing historic margins with the unbelievably great Hispanic American Community they love us and I love
(1:21:51) them in 2020 we did better than any president in more than 50 years and we're going to win record numbers of Hispanic American votes next November and the africanamerican male has been unbelievable females have got to come along a little bit got to come along but we're doing great we're doing great the radical left that's right and people from Vietnam love Trump where are where are the Viet oh they are so many great they are so great they come all dressed up in those beautiful outfits we love
(1:22:29) you thank you very much I appreciate it the radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election of 2020 and we're not going to let them rig the presidential election of 2024 do you hear that that's you every time the radical Democrats Marxist commun communist fascists indict me I consider it a great badge of honor because I'm being indicted for you thanks a lot I appreciate it how about I go home to our elegant first lady the people really love I go home darling uh tonight about 6 o' I think I'm being
(1:23:14) indicted again go the good news is she's now taking it a little bit lighter you know like oh again how many times can you do it I heard they were going to do it two more times and they said don't do it to their people to their Maniacs never forget our enemies want to stop us because we are the only ones that can stop them the only ones we're going to get your situation taken care of in California for the they want to take my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom they want to silence me because
(1:23:50) I will never let them silence you and in the end they're not after me they're after you I just happen to be unfortunately for me standing in the way here is just some of the agenda and closing that we will immediately Implement when we become we we it's all of us we're all going to become that's what it is so this is a group effort it really is to when we become the 47th president of the United States of America I will totally obliterate the Deep State we were starting we knocked out Comey
(1:24:28) and all these guys it it is deeper than anyone ever thought but we got rid of a lot of bad ones Comey got rid of them oh sir why did you fire him they found out before I even arrive at the Oval Office shortly after I win the presidency I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled it'll get settled very fast want to have people not be killed they're killing hundreds of thousands of people horrible would have never started if I were president so many things you wouldn't have had
(1:24:58) inflation you wouldn't have had the war of Ukraine China wouldn't be talking about Taiwan and you wouldn't have had the most embarrassing day in the history of our country that horrible situation that took place in Afghanistan you wouldn't have had that I think it was the lowest point I think i' actually convince Putin to go in he looked at that he said anybody that incompetent I should do whatever the hell I want and I'm the only candidate who can make this promise to you I will prevent World
(1:25:28) War III and we're much closer than anyone else we're much closer and this would be a war like no other because the level of power from Weaponry from all of the weapons the new weapons and the nuclear weapons has never been anything like it this would not be two army tanks running around shooting each other this is a level of power that nobody's ever seen before this is obliteration and I will have it stopped I will have it stopped to stop Biden's inflation catastrophe bring down the cost of energy for Californians to become energy
(1:26:04) independent again and even energy dominant we were ready to become energy dominant we were totally independent as we were just three years ago think of it three years ago we were energy independent oil was at a187 a gallon can you believe it we will drill baby drill going to bring down inflation way way down that'll knock out inflation a lot of it then we're going to get your interest rates down so you can actually go out and buy a house if you want it right now nobody's buying houses because they can't get any money from the banks
(1:26:40) right on day one I will sign a new executive order to cut Federal funding for any school pushing critical race Theory transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial sexual or political content on our children and here in California they're wiping away the names of Abraham Lincoln Thomas Jefferson and George Washington off your schools under my leadership we will once again teach our children to love America and we will have great schools that lead to great jobs so that our children can have incredible
(1:27:17) beautiful lives I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or mask mandate no mandates you want it you can have it but no mandates as I said very importantly I will keep men out of women's sports we will do that and we will gain total independence from China and I will hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for unleashing ing the China virus upon the world something will happen with that we will make the Silicon Valley Tech tyrants answer for their illegal censorship and we will restore free
(1:28:05) speech in America what they did during the election was horrible FBI and Twitter they call it Twitter files the 51 intelligence agents that all said the laptop from hell was from Russia it wasn't from Russia you know where it was from it was from hter just as I did for four years I will fully uphold your second amendment nothing happened with it that wasn't easy and I will secure our elections with special emphasis and force placed on California so that we can go all paper ballots voter ID Same Day election
(1:28:50) and you actually have to go to a Booth but until then Republicans must win and we must compete we have to compete we have to win this election if we don't win this election we're not going to have a country left anymore so in conclusion this is what we must do to restore our country to Greatness the USA is a mess our economy is crashing inflation is out of control China Russia Iran and North Korea have formed together as a menacing and destructive Coalition and a very dangerous one at that our currency is crashing and will
(1:29:28) no longer be the world standard which will be our greatest defeat in over 200 years if that happens we will revert to a status that you wouldn't believe how low we will be it won't happen with me not even a chance just like Russia would never have invaded Ukraine and China would not be even thinking about raiding Taiwan and we would have left Afghanistan with dignity and strength and pride instead of our greatest embarrassment in history we would have kept barram the Big Air Base biggest Air Base in the
(1:30:04) world we would have kept it not because of Afghanistan but because bam is one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons and we left in the dark of night we left the lights on and we left the dogs behind for those people that love dogs they always say did they take the dogs no and uh if you probably know anything about the Taliban they're not they're not big into the world of dogs so you can imagine if you took the five worst Presidents in the history of the United States and added them up they
(1:30:34) would not have done near the destruction to our country as crooked Joe Biden and the Biden Administration have done we are a failing Nation we are a nation in Decline and now these radical left lunatics want to interfere with our elections by using law enforcement it's totally corrupt and we won't let it happen that's why you must show up to vote in the California primary on super Tuesday March 5th March 5th that's your first one and we'll get to November get every Republican you know and bring them out for team Trump and
(1:31:13) we're a team we're all a team together remember what I said Maga make America great again America First this is the greatest political institution ever in the history of our country there's never been a movement like this n gwit who a great guy said last night it's a phenomena the likes of which has never happened in our country before look at the crowds forget about this crowd look outside thousands and thousands of people knowing they can't get in and they come anyway 2024 is our final battle with you at my side 2022 it's all
